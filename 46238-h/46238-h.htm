<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>

<p>Advantages out of all proportion to the importance of
the immediate aim in view are apt to accrue whenever
an honest endeavour is made to find an answer to one of
those awkward questions which are constantly arising
from the natural working of a child's mind. It was an
endeavour of this kind which formed the nucleus of the
inquiries resulting in the following little essay.</p>

<p>It is true that the effort in this case has not led to complete
success in so far as that word denotes the formulation
of an exact answer to the original question, which,
being one of a number evoked by parental experiments
in seaside sand-maze construction, was: "Father, who
made mazes first of all?" On the other hand, one hesitates
to apply so harsh a term as "failure" when bearing
in mind the many delightful excursions, rural as well as
literary, which have been involved and the alluring
vistas of possible future research that have been opened
up from time to time in the course of such excursions.</p>

<p>By no means the least of the adventitious benefits
enjoyed by the explorer has been the acquisition of a
keener sense of appreciation of the labours of the archaeologist,
the anthropologist, and other, more special, types
of investigator, any one of whom would naturally be far
better qualified to discuss the theme under consideration&mdash;at
any rate from the standpoint of his particular branch
of learning&mdash;than the present author can hope to be.</p>

<p>The special thanks of the writer are due to Professor
W.&nbsp;M. Flinders Petrie for permission to make use
of his diagram of the conjectural restoration of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
Labyrinth of Egypt, <a href="#Fig_4">Fig.&nbsp;4</a>, and the view of the shrine
of Amenemhat III, <a href="#Fig_2">Fig.&nbsp;2</a>, also for facilities to sketch
the Egyptian plaque in his collection which is shown in
<a href="#Fig_19">Fig.&nbsp;19</a> and for drawing the writer's attention thereto;
to Sir Arthur Evans for the use of his illustrations of
double axes and of the Tomb of the Double Axe which
appear as <a href="#Fig_9">Figs.&nbsp;9</a>, <a href="#Fig_10">10</a>, <a href="#Fig_11">11</a> and <a href="#Fig_12">12</a> respectively (<a href="#Fig_8">Fig.&nbsp;8</a>
is also based on one of his drawings); to M. Picard (of
the <i>Librairie A. Picard</i>) for leave to reproduce the drawing
of the Susa mosaic, <a href="#Fig_37">Fig.&nbsp;37</a>; to Mr. J.&nbsp;H. Craw, F.S.A.
(Scot.), Secretary of the Berwickshire Naturalists' Club,
for the use of the illustrations of sculptured rocks,
<a href="#Fig_128">Figs.&nbsp;128</a> and <a href="#Fig_129">129</a>; to the Rev. E.&nbsp;A. Irons for the
photograph of the Wing maze, <a href="#Fig_60">Fig.&nbsp;60</a>, and to the
Rev. G. Yorke for the figure of the Alkborough
"Julian's Bower," <a href="#Fig_59">Fig.&nbsp;59</a>.</p>

<p>The many kind-hearted persons who have earned the
gratitude of the writer by acceding to his requests for
local information, or by bringing useful references to
his notice, will perhaps take no offence if he thanks them
collectively, though very heartily, in this place. In
most cases where they are not mentioned individually in
the text they will be found quoted as authorities in the
bibliographical appendix. The present is, however, the
most fitting place in which to express a cordial acknowledgment
of the assistance rendered by the writer's
friend, Mr. G.&nbsp;F. Green, whose skill and experience
in the photographic art has been of very great value.</p>

<p>Grateful recognition must also be made of the help
and courtesy extended to the writer by the officials of
several libraries, museums, and other institutions, notably
the British Museum, the Society of Antiquaries, Sion
College, and the Royal Horticultural Society.</p>

<span class="subhead">INTRODUCTION</span></h2>

<p>A delightful air of romance and mystery surrounds
the whole subject of Labyrinths and Mazes.</p>

<p>The hedge-maze, which is the only type with which
most of us have a first-hand acquaintance, is generally
felt to be a survival of a romantic age, even though we
esteem its function as nothing higher than that of a
playground for children. Many a tender intrigue has
been woven around its dark yew alleys. Mr. Compton
Mackenzie, for example, introduces it most effectively
as a lovers' rendezvous in "The Passionate Elopement,"
and no doubt the readers of romantic literature will
recall other instances of a like nature. The story of fair
Rosamond's Bower is one which will leap to the mind in
this connection.</p>

<p>This type of maze alone is worth more than a passing
thought, but it is far from being the only, or even the
most interesting, development of the labyrinth idea.</p>

<p>What is the difference, it may be asked, between a
<i>maze</i> and a <i>labyrinth</i>? The answer is, little or none. Some
writers seem to prefer to apply the word "maze" to
hedge-mazes only, using the word "labyrinth" to denote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
the structures described by the writers of antiquity, or as
a general term for any confusing arrangement of paths.
Others, again, show a tendency to restrict the application
of the term "maze" to cases in which the idea of a puzzle
is involved.</p>

<p>It would certainly seem somewhat inappropriate to
talk of "the Cretan Maze" or "the Hampton Court
Labyrinth," but, generally speaking, we may use the
words interchangeably, regarding "maze" as merely the
northern equivalent of the classic "labyrinth." Both
words have come to signify a complex path of some kind,
but when we press for a closer definition we encounter
difficulties. We cannot, for instance, say that it is "a tortuous
branched path designed to baffle or deceive those
who attempt to find the goal to which it leads," for, though
that description holds good in some cases, it ignores
the many cases in which there is only one path, without
branches, and therefore no intent to baffle or mislead,
and others again in which there is no definite "goal."
We cannot say that it is a winding path "bounded by
walls or hedges," for in many instances there are neither
walls nor hedges. One of the most famous labyrinths,
for example, consisted chiefly of a vast and complicated
series of rooms and columns. In fact, we shall find it convenient
to leave the question of the definition of the words,
and also that of their origin, until we have examined the
various examples that exist or are known to have existed.</p>

<p>It may be necessary, here and there, to make reference
to various archæological or antiquarian books and other
writings, but the outlook of the general reader, rather
than that of the professed student, has been mainly borne
in mind.</p>

<p>The object of this book is simply to provide a readable
survey of a subject which, in view of the lure it has
exercised throughout many ages and under a variety of
forms, has been almost entirely neglected in our literature&mdash;the
subject of mazes and labyrinths treated from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
a general and not a purely archæological, horticultural,
mathematical, or artistic point of view.</p>

<p>Such references as have been made have therefore
been accompanied in most cases by some explanatory
or descriptive phrase, a provision which might be considered
unnecessary or out of place in a book written for
the trained student.</p>

<p>For the benefit of such as may wish to verify, or to
investigate more fully, any of the matters dealt with, a
classified list of references has been compiled and will be
found at the end of the book.</p>

<p>The first summary of any importance to be published
in this country on the subject was a paper by the Venerable
Edward Trollope, F.S.A., Archdeacon of Stow,
which appeared in the <i>Archaeological Journal</i> and in the
"Proceedings" of a provincial archaeological society in
1858. Nearly all subsequent writers on the subject&mdash;in
this country at any rate&mdash;have drawn largely upon the
paper in question and have made little advance upon it.</p>

<p>The "Encyclopaedia Britannica" contains an illustrated
article, written originally by a botanist and chiefly
concerned with hedge-mazes. Such books as Rouse Ball's
"Mathematical Recreations," Andrews' "Ecclesiastical
Curiosities," and Dudeney's "Amusements in Mathematics"
devote each a chapter or so to the matter, and
from time to time there have been brief displays of
interest in some aspect or other of the topic in popular
periodicals, the most notable being a pair of richly illustrated
articles in <i>Country Life</i> in 1903. A condensed
and scholarly review of the subject, in so far as it is
relevant to his main <i>thesis</i>, is contained in the first volume
of Mr. A.&nbsp;B. Cook's ponderous work on "Zeus" (1914).
A similar remark applies to the recently published
(1921) Volume I of Sir Arthur Evans's magnificent
summary of his Cretan researches, "The Palace of
Minos at Knossos." There is a characteristically
Ruskinian discourse on Labyrinths in "Fors Clavigera"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
(Fors No. 23); and an interesting, if not convincing,
section of Mr. E.&nbsp;O. Gordon's "Prehistoric London"
adduces a certain amount of labyrinth lore in support
of the Trojan origin of the metropolis. So far as the
writer has been able to ascertain, no book dealing solely
with the subject has hitherto appeared in our language.</p>

<p>In 1915&ndash;16 there appeared posthumously in the
<i>Revue Archéologique</i> a very remarkable series of articles
on "Les Fallacieux Détours du Labyrinthe" by a brilliant
young French archaeologist, M. Robert de Launay, who
was killed on the field of honour at Neuville-St.-Vaast in
May 1915. The articles are characterised by great boldness
and enthusiasm and show a wide range of knowledge,
but it is probable that, if the author had lived, mature
consideration would have led him to modify some of his
conclusions. This is the most recent work of importance
on the subject, though the new work by Sir A. Evans
mentioned above contains much interesting and valuable
information on certain aspects.</p>

<p>In the following chapters an attempt is made to set
forth, as readably as may be, an account of the various
devices in which the labyrinth-idea has been embodied,
to indicate where examples may be found, to give some
notion of the speculations which have been made regarding
their origins, and to consider the possibilities of the
idea from the point of view of amusement and recreation.</p>

<p>The earliest labyrinths of which mention is made by
the classic writers are those of Egypt and Crete, and we
shall find it convenient to consider these first of all. We
will then notice the other labyrinths alluded to by the
writers of antiquity, and pass on to a consideration of
labyrinthine designs introduced by way of ornament or
symbolism in various objects of later classic art. We shall
see that the labyrinth-idea was adopted and developed by
the Christian Church in the Middle Ages, and will note
its progress as a medium of horticultural embellishment.
It will be interesting to examine the mathematical principles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
such as they are, which underlie the construction
or solution of mazes, also to see in what a number of
ways these principles may be applied.</p>

<p>We shall find that our inquiry will bring us into contact
with a greater variety of subjects than one would at
first be inclined to imagine, and that labyrinths and
mazes need not by any means be considered as exclusively
a concern of archaeologists and children.</p>

<p>Incidentally we may help to rescue from threatened
oblivion a certain class of native antiquities, small and
diminishing in number, but surely worth sufficient
attention to ensure their preservation, namely, the <i>turf labyrinths</i>.</p>

<p>As to the actual origin and primary purpose of these
devices we cannot be dogmatic on the evidence before
us, and herein, perhaps, lies a good deal of their charm.
When we can classify and date with precision any object
which is not of a utilitarian nature we relegate it at once
to our mental museum, and a museum is only too apt to
become an <i>oubliette</i>. But when there is a considerable
margin for speculation, or, as we usually say, a certain
amount of "mystery" in the case, we are more likely to
find pleasure in rehandling it, looking at it from different
points of view and wondering about it. Let us grant, by
all means, that there are quite sufficient unsolved riddles
in nature and life without raising up artificial mysteries.
Let us even admit that when evidence is available (which,
by the way, is not the same thing as <i>existent</i>) it is better
to settle a question straight away than to leave it open to
further argument. At the same time, let us not be too
hasty in accepting speculations, however shrewd, as
proved facts. Antiquarian books should naturally be as
free as possible from actual misstatements, but they
have lost all their charm when they become collections
of bald dogmatic statements or mere descriptive catalogues.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE EGYPTIAN LABYRINTH</span>

<span class="subhead">(i) <i>Accounts of the Ancient Writers</i></span></h2>

<p>The earliest structure of any kind to which we find the
word <i>labyrinth</i> applied was a huge building situated in
the North of Egypt, a land always noted for its stupendous
monuments, and was probably constructed more than
2000 years before the commencement of the Christian era.</p>

<p>We live in an age when the use of constructional steel
enables the dreams of the architect to materialise in many
ways that would astonish the builders of old; nevertheless,
the modern citizen, whatever his nationality, can
rarely resist a feeling akin to awe when making his first
acquaintance with such works as the Pyramids of Egypt.
One can imagine, then, what a profound effect these
massive edifices must have exerted on the minds of
travellers in earlier ages.</p>

<p>We find, as we might expect, many wild exaggerations
in individual descriptions and corresponding discrepancies
between the various accounts of any particular
monument, and this is to some extent the case with
regard to the Egyptian Labyrinth.</p>

<p>A fairly detailed and circumstantial account has come
down to us from the Greek writer Herodotus.</p>

<p>Herodotus, who is rightly spoken of as the Father of
History, was born about 484 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> and lived about sixty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
years, of which he spent a considerable number in travelling
about over most of the then known world. Those
who are fortunate enough to be able to read his works in
their original tongue are charmed by their freshness,
simplicity, and harmonious rhythm, but those who look
to him for accurate information on any but contemporary
events or matters with which he was personally
acquainted are apt to find a rather too credulous acceptance
of the wonderful. No doubt the poetical instinct in
Herodotus was stronger than the critical spirit of the true
historian, but, so far as the records of his personal observations
are concerned, there seems to be no reason to
accuse him of gross exaggeration.</p>

<p>The Labyrinth of Egypt he himself visited, as he tells
us in his second book, and seems to have been considerably
impressed by it. After describing how the Egyptians
divided the land into twelve parts, or <i>nomes</i>, and set a
king over each, he says that they agreed to combine
together to leave a memorial of themselves. They then
constructed the Labyrinth, just above Lake Moeris, and
nearly opposite the city of crocodiles (Crocodilopolis).
"I found it," he says, "greater than words could tell, for,
although the temple at Ephesus and that at Samos are
celebrated works, yet all of the works and buildings of
the Greeks put together would certainly be inferior to
this labyrinth as regards labour and expense." Even the
pyramids, he tells us, were surpassed by the Labyrinth.
"It has twelve covered courts, with opposite doors, six
courts on the North side and six on the South, all communicating
with one another and with one wall surrounding
them all. There are two sorts of rooms, one sort
above, the other sort below ground, fifteen hundred of
each sort, or three thousand in all." He says that he was
allowed to pass through the upper rooms only, the lower
range being strictly guarded from visitors, as they contained
the tombs of the kings who had built the Labyrinth,
also the tombs of the sacred crocodiles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
The upper rooms he describes as being of super-human
size, and the system of passages through the
courts, rooms, and colonnades very intricate and bewildering.
The roof of the whole affair, he says, is of stone
and the walls are covered with carvings. Each of the
courts is surrounded by columns of white stone, perfectly
joined. Outside the Labyrinth, and at one corner of it,
is a pyramid about 240 feet in height, with huge figures
carved upon it and approached by an underground
passage.</p>

<p>Herodotus expresses even greater admiration, however,
for the lake beside the Labyrinth, which he describes
as being of vast size and artificially constructed, having
two pyramids arising from its bed, each supporting a
colossal seated statue. The water for the lake, he says, is
brought from the Nile by a canal.</p>

<p>The Labyrinth and the lake are also described at some
length by another great traveller, Strabo, who lived about
four centuries after Herodotus. He wrote, amongst other
works, a Geography of the World in seventeen volumes,
the last of which treats of Egypt and other parts of Africa.
Like Herodotus, he speaks of the Labyrinth from personal
observation. After referring to the lake and the
manner in which it is used as a storage reservoir for the
water of the Nile, he proceeds to describe the Labyrinth,
"a work equal to the Pyramids." He says it is "a large
palace composed of as many palaces as there were formerly
<i>nomes</i>. There are an equal number of courts, surrounded
by columns and adjoining one another, all in a
row and constituting one building, like a long wall with
the courts in front of it. The entrances to the courts are
opposite the wall; in front of these entrances are many
long covered alleys with winding intercommunicating
passages, so that a stranger could not find his way in or
out unless with a guide. Each of these structures is roofed
with a single slab of stone, as are also the covered alleys,
no timber or any other material being used." If one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
ascends to the roof, he says, one looks over "a field of
stone." The courts were in a line, supported by a row of
twenty-seven monolithic columns, the walls also being
constructed of stones of as great a size.</p>

<p>"At the end of the building is the royal tomb, consisting
of a square pyramid and containing the body of
<i>Imandes</i>."</p>

<p>Strabo says that it was the custom of the twelve <i>nomes</i>
of Egypt to assemble, with their priests and priestesses,
each <i>nome</i> in its own court, for the purpose of sacrificing
to the gods and administering justice in important matters.</p>

<p>He mentions that the inhabitants of the particular
<i>nome</i> in the vicinity worshipped the crocodile which was
kept in the lake and answered to the name of Suchus
(Sebek). This animal was apparently quite tame and used
to be presented by visitors with offerings of bread, flesh,
wine, honey, and milk.</p>

<p>In certain parts of his works Strabo speaks rather disrespectfully
of Herodotus as a writer, classing him as a
marvel-monger, but it will be seen that in several important
respects these two accounts of the Egyptian
Labyrinth are in fair agreement.</p>

<p>Another writer of about the same period as Strabo,
known as Diodorus the Sicilian, wrote a long, rambling
compilation which he called a "Historical Library" and
in which he describes the Egyptian Labyrinth and Lake
Moeris. He says the latter was constructed by King
Moeris, who left a place in the middle where he built
himself a sepulchre and two pyramids&mdash;one for himself
and one for his queen&mdash;surmounted by colossal seated
statues. Diodorus says that the king gave the money
resulting from the sale of the fish caught in the lake,
amounting to a silver talent a day, to his wife "to buy
her pins."</p>

<p>A generation or so later the Roman writer Pomponius
Mela gives a short account of this labyrinth, probably
at second-hand, and early in the first century of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
Christian era Pliny, in his "Natural History," has a good
deal to say on the subject. He refers to labyrinths generally
as "the most stupendous works on which mankind
has expended its labours."</p>

<p>Regarding the Egyptian Labyrinth he says, "there
exists still, in the <i>nome</i> of Heracleopolites, a labyrinth
first built, it is said, three thousand six hundred years
ago, by King Petesuchis or Tithoës," but he goes on to
quote Herodotus, to the effect that it was built by twelve
kings, the last of whom was Psammetichus, and two
other writers who give the king's name as Moiris and
Moteris respectively, "whilst others, again, assert that it
was a building dedicated to the Sun-god, an opinion
which is generally accepted."</p>

<p>He also refers to the fact that the roof was of stone,
and notes as a surprising point that the parts around the
entrance were constructed of Parian marble, whilst the
columns of the other parts were of syenite. "This great
mass is so solidly built that the lapse of time has been
quite unable to destroy it, but it has been badly ravaged
by the people of Heracleopolites, who have always
detested it. To describe the whole of it in detail would
be quite impossible, as it is divided up into regions and
prefectures, called <i>nomes</i>, thirty in number, with a great
palace to each; in addition it must contain temples of all
the gods of Egypt and forty statues of Nemesis in the
same number of sacred shrines, as well as numerous
pyramids." He describes it further as having "banquet
halls reached by steep ascents, flights of ninety steps
leading down from the porticoes, porphyritic columns,
figures of gods and hideous monsters, and statues of
kings. Some of the palaces are so made that the opening
of a door makes a terrifying sound as of thunder. Most
of the buildings are in total darkness. Outside the labyrinth
there is another great heap of buildings, called the
'Pteron,' under which are passages leading to other
subterranean palaces."</p>

<span class="subhead">THE EGYPTIAN LABYRINTH (<i>continued</i>)</span>

<span class="subhead">(ii) <i>Accounts of Later Explorers</i></span></h2>

<p>A structure which evoked so much wonder and admiration
in ancient times can hardly fail to have aroused the
curiosity of later generations, but no serious attempts to
locate it seem to have been made by Europeans until
several centuries later. It was then far too late to observe
any of its glories, for it was all but destroyed in Roman
times, and a village sprang up on its site, largely constructed
from its debris.</p>

<p>The Italian traveller Gemelli-Careri, who visited Egypt
in 1693, refers to a subterranean labyrinth which he saw
in the neighbourhood of the Pyramids. In the English
version of his account we read: "... the Arabs conducted
us to see a Labyrinth, where the Ancients bury'd
Birds. We went down a narrow Passage into a Room
out of which we crept on our Bellies through a Hole to
certain ways where a man may walk well enough upright.
On both sides of these there are Urns, in which
the Birds were bury'd; there is now nothing in them but
a little dust. These Ways are cut out of a <i>nitrous</i> Stone,
and run several miles like a City under ground, which
they call a Labyrinth." There is nothing in this description,
however, to suggest that these works had any connection
with the Labyrinth of the ancients.</p>

<p>In 1700 Paul Lucas, the Antiquary to Louis XIV,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
went on a voyage to Egypt, and, in the book in which he
subsequently published the account of his travels, gives
us some idea of the state of the remains in his time, but
his account is very rambling and unreliable. <a href="#Fig_1">Fig.&nbsp;1</a> is a
view which he gives of part of the ruins of the alleged
labyrinth.</p>

<p>Lucas states that an old Arab who accompanied his
party professed to have explored the interior of the ruins
many years before, and to have penetrated into its subterranean
passages to a large chamber surrounded by
several niches, "like little shops," whence endless alleys
and other rooms branched off. By the time of Lucas's
visit, however, these passages could not be traced, and
he concluded that they had become blocked up by
debris.</p>

<p>The next explorer to visit the spot seems to have been
Dr. Richard Pococke, whose "Description of the East"
appeared in 1743. "We observed at a great distance,"
he says, "the temple of the Labyrinth, and being about a
league from it, I observed several heaps as of ruins,
covered with sand, and many stones all round as if there
had been some great building there: they call it the town
of Caroon (Bellet Caroon). It seemed to have been of a
considerable breadth from east to west, and the buildings
extended on each side towards the north to the Lake
Moeris and the temple. This without doubt is the spot
of the famous Labyrinth which Herodotus says was built
by the twelve kings of Egypt." He describes what he
takes to be the pyramid of the Labyrinth as a building
about 165 feet long by 80 broad, very much ruined, and
says it is called the "Castle of Caroon."</p>

<p>The neighbourhood was also explored by the archaeologists
who accompanied that remarkable expedition
sent out by Napoleon at the end of the eighteenth century,
and one of them, Jomard, believed that he had discovered
the ruins of the Labyrinth.</p>

<div id="ip_12" class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img id="Fig_1" src="images/i_034.jpg" width="500" height="386" alt="" /><div class="caption">Fig. 1. Egyptian Labyrinth. Portion of Ruins, <i>circ.</i> 1700. (<i>Paul Lucas</i>)</div></div>

<p>In 1843 a Prussian expedition, under K.&nbsp;R. Lepsius,
carried out considerable excavations in the locality and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
claimed to have established the actual site of the Labyrinth,
attaching great importance to a series of brick
chambers which they unearthed. The data furnished by
this party, however, were not altogether of a convincing
character, and it was felt that further evidence was required
before their conclusions could be accepted.</p>

<p>G.&nbsp;M. Ebers, a pupil of Lepsius, and one who did
much to popularise the study of Egyptology by a series
of novels, said that, if one climbed the pyramid hard by,
one could see that the ruins of the Labyrinth had a
horseshoe shape, but that was all.</p>

<p>The actual site of the Egyptian Labyrinth was finally
identified by Professor Flinders Petrie in 1888. He found
that the brick chambers which Lepsius took to be part
of the Labyrinth were only remains of the Roman town
built by its destroyers, the Labyrinth itself being so
thoroughly demolished that only a great bed of fragments
remained. Even from this dreary waste of stone
chips, however, a few items of interest were discovered,
including scattered bits of foundations, a great well, two
door-jambs&mdash;one to the north and one to the south&mdash;two
granite shrines and part of another, several fragments
of statues and a large granite seated figure of the
king who is now generally recognised to have been the
builder of the Labyrinth, namely Amenemhat (or Amenemhe)
III of the XIIth Dynasty (also known as Lampares),
who reigned about twenty-three centuries <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>
<a href="#Fig_2">Fig.&nbsp;2</a>, which, like the diagram shown in <a href="#Fig_4">Fig.&nbsp;4</a>, is
reproduced by the kind permission of Professor Petrie
from his book "The Labyrinth, Gerzeh and Mazghuneh"
(1912), represents one of the shrines dedicated to the
founder. Sufficient of the original foundations remained
to enable the size and orientation of the building to be
roughly determined.</p>

<p>The Labyrinth must have covered an area of about
1000 feet from east to west by 800 feet from north to
south, and was situated to the east of Lake Moeris,
opposite the ancient town of Arsinoë (Crocodilopolis),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
and just to the south of the pyramid of Hawara, in the
district known nowadays as the Fayûm.</p>

<p>The mummified remains of the builder of the Labyrinth,
King Amenemhat III, and of his daughter Sebekneferu,
have been discovered in this pyramid, which is
symmetrical about the same N.-S. meridian as the
Labyrinth.</p>

<p>Professor Petrie reviewed all that the classic writers
had reported concerning the Labyrinth, and concluded
that, in spite of their differences, each had contributed
some item of value. The discrepancies between the
descriptions of Herodotus and Strabo he attributes to
the probable decay or destruction of the upper storey in
the intervening centuries.</p>

<p>Many attempts have been made to visualise the Labyrinth
as it existed in the time of Herodotus. <a href="#Fig_3">Fig.&nbsp;3</a> shows,
in plan, one such reconstruction, according to the Italian
archaeologist Canina. The actual plan of the Labyrinth
would appear to have differed from this in many respects,
judging by the indications found by Professor Petrie.
The latter drew up a tentative restoration based upon
the descriptions of Herodotus and Strabo so far as these
tallied with the remains discovered by him.</p>

<p>He suggests that the shrines which he found formed
part of a series of nine, ranged along the foot of the
pyramid, each attached to a columned court, the whole
series of courts opening opposite a series of twenty-seven
columns arranged down the length of a great hall running
east and west; on the other side of this hall would be
another series of columned courts, six in number and
larger than the others, separated by another long hall
from a further series of six (<a href="#Fig_4">Fig.&nbsp;4</a>).</p>

<p>In spite of the scantiness of the present remains and
the discrepancies between the various reports that have
reached us from ancient times, we can at least be reasonably
certain that this, the earliest structure to which the
term "labyrinth" λαβύρινθος [Greek: labyrinthos] is known to have been
applied, did actually exist; that it was of the nature of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
stupendous architectural monument, that it is of great
antiquity&mdash;having been built over 4000 years ago at
any rate&mdash;and that its site is definitely known.</p>

<div id="ip_15" class="figcenter" style="width: 448px;"><img id="Fig_3" src="images/i_040.jpg" width="448" height="450" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span>&mdash;Egyptian Labyrinth. Restored Plan. (<i>Canina.</i>)</div></div>

<p>Its original object is still a matter of conjecture. It is
quite possible that it was used as a meeting-place for the
nomes, which would have been about twenty-two in
number at the time of the XIIth Dynasty, but it is perhaps
more probable that it was intended as a sepulchral
monument. In any case it is plain, from the fragments of
various gods and goddesses found on the site, that it was
a centre of worship of a great variety of deities.</p>

<p>From an almost illegible inscription on a great weather-beaten
block of granite, deciphered, with great difficulty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
as a dedication by a King Ptolemy to a Queen Cleopatra,
Professor Petrie concluded that as late as the beginning
of the second century <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> the building was still in royal
care, but not very long afterwards it was considerably
despoiled. Whatever may have been its original object,
it afforded several generations the advantages of a most
convenient stone-quarry.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE CRETAN LABYRINTH</span>

<span class="subhead">(i) <i>The Story of Theseus and the Minotaur</i></span></h2>

<p>Charles Kingsley in "The Heroes" and Nathaniel
Hawthorne in "Tanglewood Tales" have familiarised
most English-speaking people with the story of the exploits
of Theseus, and doubtless most folk have some
acquaintance with the first volume of Plutarch's "Lives,"
but it will not be out of place here to recall the portions
of the legend which are associated with our particular
theme, the parts, that is to say, which concern the Labyrinth
of Crete. In doing so we will follow the version
given by Plutarch.</p>

<p>This Greco-Roman historian flourished in the latter
half of the first century of our era. His information as to
the deeds of Theseus, already for many centuries a staple
ingredient in popular legendry, was drawn from the accounts
of the early Greek writers Bacchylides (fifth century
<span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>), Cleidemus (circ. 420&ndash;350 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>), Philochorus
(circ. 306&ndash;260 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>), and others.</p>

<p>The Cretan exploit was perhaps the most romantic of
the long series of heroic acts attributed to Theseus. Let
us briefly recall it.</p>

<p>Aegeus, the father of Theseus, was King of Athens.
At that time there reigned at Knossos, in Crete, a monarch
called Minos, who held sway over what was then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
the most powerful maritime state in the Mediterranean.
Minos had a son named Androgeos, who, during his
travels in Attica, was treacherously set upon and slain, or
so his father was informed. In consequence of this Minos
imposed a penalty on the Athenians in the form of a
tribute to be paid once every nine years, such tribute to
consist of seven youths and seven maidens, who were to
be shipped to Knossos at the appointed periods.</p>

<p>There was at the court of Minos an exceedingly
clever and renowned artificer or engineer, Daedalus by
name, to whom all sorts of miraculous inventions are
ascribed. This Daedalus had devised an ingenious structure,
the "Labyrinth," so contrived that if anybody were
placed therein he would find it practically impossible to
discover the exit without a guide.</p>

<p>The Labyrinth was designed as a dwelling for, or at
any rate was inhabited by, a hideous and cruel being
called the Minotaur, a monstrous offspring of Queen
Pasiphaë, wife of Minos. The Minotaur is described
as being half man and half bull, or a man with a bull's
head, a ferocious creature that destroyed any unfortunate
human beings who might come within its power.
According to report, the youths and maidens of the
Athenian tribute were periodically, one by one, thrust
into the Labyrinth, where, after futile wanderings in the
endeavour to find an exit, they were finally caught and
slain by the Minotaur.</p>

<p>When Theseus arrived at the court of Aegeus, having
been brought up hitherto by his mother in a distant
seclusion, he was distressed to find that his father's joy
in the reunion was overcast by a deepening sadness. On
inquiring the reason for this, he learned of the vindictive
tribute laid upon the kingdom, and that the time for the
third payment was approaching.</p>

<p>"Let me make one of the fourteen," said the valiant
youth. "I will find a way to slay this Minotaur, and then
there will be no further need for the tribute."</p>

<div id="ip_18" class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img id="Fig_5" src="images/i_044.jpg" width="500" height="347" alt="" /><div class="caption">Fig. 5. Cretan Labyrinth. (<i>Florentine Picture Chronicle.</i>)</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
After various attempts to dissuade him, Aegeus at
length consented, but stipulated that if Theseus were
successful in his design the tribute ship should, on its
return voyage, hoist a white sail in place of the black one
which it customarily bore.</p>

<p>In due course Theseus came to Knossos, where, shortly
after his arrival, he attracted the attention of Ariadne, the
fair-haired daughter of Minos. Youth and love conspired
against age and rancour, and the fair damsel arranged to
provide the hero with a clue of thread and a sword before
he was cast into the Labyrinth. One end of this thread
was to be fastened at the entrance and the rest unrolled
as he advanced.</p>

<p>Theseus followed his instructions, met the Minotaur
in its lair and, after a terrific combat, overcame and slew
it, after which he retraced his steps by means of the
thread and made his escape from the Labyrinth.</p>

<p>By some means or other he contrived to liberate the
other prisoners and to obtain possession of the tribute
ship. Then, with the fair Ariadne on board, they set
sail for Athens.</p>

<p>They do not appear to have been too eager to reach
their destination, however, for the party found time to
celebrate their escape with dance and song on the islands
<i>en route</i>. It is said that on the island of Delos they performed
a peculiar dance called the <i>Geranos</i>, or "Crane
Dance," in which they went through the motions of
threading the Labyrinth, and that this dance was perpetuated
by the natives of that island until fairly recent
times.</p>

<p>Theseus seems to have marred his home-coming by
two little displays of thoughtlessness that might be considered
reprehensible in anybody but a Greek hero. In
the first place, he left fair Ariadne behind on the island of
Naxos; secondly, he entirely overlooked his father's request
concerning the change of sail, with the result that
poor old Aegeus, on the look-out for the returning ship,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
saw the black sail in the distance, concluded that his son
had failed in his encounter with the Minotaur, threw
himself into the sea and was drowned. Hence that sea
was called the Aegean, and is so called to this day.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Fig_5">Fig.&nbsp;5</a> we reproduce an early Italian drawing in
which the various incidents in the story are seen simultaneously.
This picture is one of a remarkable series,
attributed to Baccio Baldini and known as the Florentine
Picture Chronicle. The collection was for many
years the property of John Ruskin, but is now jealously
treasured by the British Museum. A contemporary
engraving, of the school of Finiguerra, seems to be based
on this picture (<a href="#Fig_6">Fig.&nbsp;6</a>).</p>

<p>There are many versions of the legend, some of them
greatly at variance with others. For instance, Philochorus,
an eminent writer on the antiquities of Athens, gives in
his "Atthis" a very rationalistic account of the affair,
stating that the Labyrinth was nothing but a dungeon
where Minos imprisoned the Athenian youths until such
time as they were given as prizes to the victors in the
sports that were held in honour of his murdered son.
He held also that the monster was simply a military
officer, whose brutal disposition, in conjunction with
his name, Tauros, may have given rise to the Minotaur
myth.</p>

<p>The Cretan poet Epimenides, who lived in the sixth
century <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, says that Theseus was aided in his escape
from the dark Labyrinth by means of the light radiated
by a crown of blazing gems and gold which Bacchus
gave to Ariadne.</p>

<p>Aristotle, according to Plutarch, stated in a work
which has not come down to us his belief that the
Athenian youths were not put to death by Minos but
were retained as slaves. Plutarch, moreover, deplores
the abuse which Greek tradition had heaped upon the
name of Minos, pointing out that Homer and Hesiod
had referred to him in very honourable terms, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
that he was reputed to have laid down the principles
of justice.</p>

<p>According to the classic faith, he was born of Zeus,
the supreme God of the Greeks, and Europa, daughter
of man, both marriage and birth taking place in the
Dictaean Cave, not far from Knossos. He received the
laws, like another Moses, direct from God, and after
administering them during his life on earth continued
to do so in the underworld after his death.</p>

<div id="ip_21" class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img id="Fig_6" src="images/i_048.jpg" width="500" height="376" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 6.</span>&mdash;Cretan Labyrinth. (Italian Engraving; School of
<i>Finiguerra.</i>)</div></div>

<p>The probability is, as Professor Murray has suggested,
that Minos was a general name, like "Pharaoh" in
Egypt, or "Caesar" in Rome, bestowed upon each of
a number of Cretan kings of a certain type. A mark
either of the respect in which the name was held or of
the colonising power of the monarch or monarchs in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
question is seen in the application of the name Minoa
to several towns and villages scattered along the northern
shores of the eastern Mediterranean.</p>

<p>The name Daedalus has likewise been thought by
some to have been applied indiscriminately to various
artificers and inventors of unusual ingenuity. The principal
feats associated with this name are, in addition to
the planning of the Labyrinth, the construction of a
<i>Choros</i>, or dancing-place, for Ariadne, the modelling of
a great hollow cow for Pasiphaë, wife of Minos, in order
that she might interview the great white bull for which
she had conceived an unnatural affection (the outcome
being, in the words of Euripides, "A form commingled,
and a monstrous birth, half man, half bull, in twofold
shape combined"), and the invention of wings, wherewith
Daedalus escaped from the Labyrinth when imprisoned
there by Minos for his share in the Pasiphaë
episode. Daedalus was also credited with the invention
of the auger, the plumb-line and other tools, and of
masts and sails for ships.</p>

<p>The Theseus-Minotaur incident has been often
celebrated in ancient and mediaeval art, instances of
which we shall later have occasion to mention. Modern
artists, also, have not disdained the theme; a particularly
fine example is the colossal marble group by
Canova (1819), now at the Museum of Art History
at Vienna, formerly in the Theseus Temple in the
Volksgarten.</p>

<p>The question naturally arises: Was there actually such
a thing as the Labyrinth, and, if so, where was it and
what was its nature?</p>

<span class="subhead">THE CRETAN LABYRINTH (<i>continued</i>)</span>

<span class="subhead">(ii) <i>The Caverns of Gortyna</i></span></h2>

<p>According to the Romano-Greek writer <span class="locked">Apollodorus,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></span>
whose "Bibliotheke" consisted of a history of the world
from the fall of Troy onwards, Daedalus built the Labyrinth
at Knossos for King Minos on the lines of the
Egyptian Labyrinth, but of only one-hundredth part of
the magnitude of the latter. This statement, which was
repeated by various other ancient writers such as Pliny
and Diodorus, caused many subsequent inquirers to look
for evidence in Crete of a building similar to, though
smaller than, that described by Herodotus and Strabo.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> Often erroneously alluded to as "the Athenian Grammarian."</p></div>

<p>Nothing corresponding to such a description appeared
to exist, but at Gortyna, on the south side of
Crete, there was a remarkable series of winding passages,
opening on the side of Mount Ida. Some authors of
antiquity, such as the Roman poets Catullus and Claudian,
held the opinion that this cavern, or one of the many
other caves or quarries in Crete, was the real Labyrinth,
and this view has been largely entertained in recent
times, right up to the beginning of the present century.</p>

<p>The first modern traveller of note to explore the
cavern was the French botanist, G.&nbsp;P. de Tournefort,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
who spent three years, from 1700 to 1702, travelling
about Asia Minor and the Levant.</p>

<p>Tournefort's book, as well as being a mine of information
on various subjects, makes delightful reading,
whether in the original French or in John Ozell's
English translation of 1718, from which we quote.</p>

<p>"This famous place," he says, referring to the Labyrinth,
which he visited on July 1, 1700, "is a subterranean
Passage in manner of a Street, which by a thousand
Intricacies and Windings, as it were by mere
Chance, and without the least Regularity, pervades the
whole Cavity or Inside of a little Hill at the foot of
Mount Ida, southwards, three miles from Gortyna.
The Entrance into this Labyrinth is by a natural Opening,
seven or eight Paces broad, but so low that even a
middle-siz'd Man can't pass through without stooping.</p>

<p>"The Flooring of this Entrance is very rugged and
unequal; the Ceiling flat and even, terminated by divers
Beds of Stone, laid horizontally one upon another.</p>

<p>"The first thing you come at is a kind of Cavern exceeding
rustick, and gently sloping: in this there is
nothing extraordinary, but as you move forward the
place is perfectly surprizing; nothing but Turnings and
crooked By-ways. The principal Alley, which is less
perplexing than the rest, in length about 1200 Paces,
leads to the further end of the Labyrinth, and concludes
in two large beautiful Apartments, where Strangers rest
themselves with pleasure. Tho' this Alley divides itself,
at its Extremity, into two or three Branches, yet the
dangerous part of the Labyrinth is not there, but rather
at its Entrance, about some thirty paces from the Cavern
on the left hand. If a Man strikes into any other Path,
after he has gone a good way, he is so bewildered among
a thousand Twistings, Twinings, Sinuosities, Crinkle-Crankles
and Turn-again Lanes, that he could scarce
ever get out again without the utmost danger of being
lost."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
He refers to various inscriptions in charcoal, mostly
names of former visitors, and notes various dates ranging
from 1444 to 1699. "We too," he says, "wrote the Year
of the Lord 1700 in three different places, with a black
stone." "After a thorow Examination of the Structure
of this Labyrinth we all concurred in Opinion, that it
could never have been what <i>Belonius</i> and some other of
the Moderns have fancy'd; namely, an antient Quarry,
out of which were dug the Stones that built the Towns of
Gortyna and Gnossus. Is it likely that they would go for
Stone above a thousand paces deep, into a place so full
of odd Turnings?... Again, how could they draw
these Stones through a place so pinch'd in, that we were
forc'd to crawl our way out for above a hundred paces
together? Besides, the Mountain is so craggy and full
of Precipices that we had all the difficulty in the World
to ride up it.... It is likewise observable, that the Stone
of this Labyrinth has neither a good Hue nor a competent
Hardness; it is downright dingy, and resembling that of
the Mountains near which Gortyna stands.</p>

<p>"... It is therefore much more probable, that the
Labyrinth is a natural Cavity, which in times past some
body out of curiosity took a fancy to try what they could
make of, by widening most of those Passages that were
too much straitened.... Doubtless some Shepherds
having discovered these subterraneous Conduits, gave
occasion to more considerable People to turn it into this
marvellous Maze to serve for an Asylum in the Civil
Wars or to skreen themselves from the Fury of a Tyrannical
Government: at present it is only a Retreat for
Bats and the like."</p>

<p>Tournefort stayed for a while with an ignorant priest,
"who would have persuaded us in his balderdash Italian
that there was an ancient Prophecy wrote on the Walls
of the Labyrinth importing that the Czar of Muscovy
was very soon to be Master of the Ottoman Empire and
deliver the Greeks from the Slavery of the Turks." He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
adds: "Whatever Scrawlings are made upon the Walls of
the Labyrinth by Travellers, these Simpletons swallow
down for Prophecies." He mentions also a labyrinth at
Candia, but says it must not be confused with the Labyrinth
of tradition, "which, from antique Medals, appears
to have been in the town of Gnossus."</p>

<p>Dr. Richard Pococke, to whose description of the
Egyptian Labyrinth we referred in Chapter III, paid a
visit to Gortyna about forty years after Tournefort. He
says that the "labyrinth" was shown to him, but that it
was evidently nothing more than the quarry out of which
the town was built. He points out that the real Labyrinth
was at Knossos and that nothing was left of it in Pliny's
time.</p>

<p>Another French traveller, C.&nbsp;E. Savary, visited the
spot about 1788. He came to the conclusion that this
was the Labyrinth of the Minotaur, but regarded it as
something distinct from that built by Daedalus at
Knossos.</p>

<p>A very interesting account of the Gortyna cavern is
that contained in the Journal of C.&nbsp;R. Cockerell, <span class="locked">R.A.,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></span>
who travelled in Southern Europe and the Levant during
the years 1810 to 1817. He and his party entered the
"labyrinth" by an inconspicuous hole in the rock in a
steep part of the hill (Mount Ida) and found themselves
in an intricately winding passage. They had taken the
precaution to bring with them a great length of string
wound upon two sticks, and it was fortunate that they
did so, for "the windings," says Cockerell, "bewildered
us at once, and, my compass being broken, I was quite
ignorant as to where I was. The clearly intentional intricacy
and apparently endless number of galleries impressed
me with a sense of horror and fascination I
cannot describe. At every ten steps one was arrested, and
had to turn to right or left, sometimes to choose one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
three or four roads. What if one should lose the clue!"
He relates how a poor lunatic had insisted on accompanying
them all the way from Candia and following them
into the cavern. This man, together with a boy who had
a lantern, wandered off and caused the rest of the party&mdash;except
some Turks, who philosophically remarked
that God takes care of madmen&mdash;to feel much alarm on
their account. They were, however, discovered again an
hour later, the boy half dead with fright.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> Edited and published by his son, S.&nbsp;P. Cockerell, in 1903.</p></div>

<p>Chambers opened off from the passages, and contained
much evidence of former visitors, in the shape
of names scratched on the walls, such as "Spinola,"
"Hawkins, 1794," "Fiott," and many of a Jewish
character. All of the passage ends were infested with
bats, which rose in thousands when one of the party fired
a pistol. Lichens grew here and there, and in one place
arose a spring. There were signs of metallic substances
in the rock, but not sufficient, thought Cockerell, to
warrant the supposition that the place was a mine. The
stone was sandy, stratified and easily cut, and the air
was dry. The surface of the rock appeared to have been
prepared with a chisel.</p>

<p>The passage was 8 or 10 feet wide, and from 4 to 10
feet high; in many places it had fallen in. Cockerell concluded
that the excavation was probably made in the
days of Minos as a storehouse for corn and valuables.
He mentions that he was informed by natives that the
cavern extended right through the mountain and was
three miles in length; also that a sow once wandered in
and emerged some years later with a litter of pigs!</p>

<p>About fifty years after Cockerell's visit, the cavern
was explored by Capt. T.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;B. Spratt, R.N., who, in his
"Travels and Researches in Crete" (1865), tells us that
the Cretans "have long since walled and stopped up its
inner and unknown extremes, so as not to be lost in its
inner intricacies." He discusses the probable location of
the traditional Labyrinth and concludes that probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
the latter is to be found in some similar cavern in the
neighbourhood of Knossos. He mentions that there is,
in fact, an excavation in the side of the ridge overlooking
Knossos which the natives state to be the entrance to
extensive catacombs, but that it is choked up by the falling
in of its sides.</p>

<p>He reproduces a sketch by Sieber of the Gortyna
Cavern (<a href="#Fig_7">Fig.&nbsp;7</a>); this, he says, took the artist three
days to make. Capt. Spratt, by the way, points out that
the meander pattern, which is so common a feature of
Greek ornament, and is associated by some writers with
the origin of the labyrinth idea, may very well have been
derived from the square-spiral trenches which are commonly
constructed by Eastern gardeners for irrigational
purposes. (See also Chapter VIII.)</p>

<p>Whatever the original purpose and function of the
Gortyna Cavern may have been, it was certainly a "labyrinth"
in the extended sense, and no doubt the classic
writers themselves would have had no hesitation in admitting
the use of that word to describe it, but, as we
shall see, discoveries of recent years have considerably
diminished its claim to be considered as the original
Labyrinth of the Minotaur.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE CRETAN LABYRINTH (<i>continued</i>)</span>

<span class="subhead">(iii) <i>Knossos</i></span></h2>

<p>A few miles to the north-east of Gortyna, and not far
south of the north coast town of Candia, lay, at the base
of the hill of Kephala, a few ruined walls indicating the
site of the ancient city of Knossos. These walls consisted
of large blocks of gypsum and bore curious engraved
marks.</p>

<p>For many years Dr. A.&nbsp;J. Evans (now Sir Arthur
Evans) had been convinced that excavation of this site
would probably bring to light evidence of a system of
writing which might be of interest in connection with
the origin of the Greek system, but it was not until the
year 1900 that he finally obtained a concession enabling
him to explore the spot. The resulting discoveries were
of such an astonishing nature, and of such absorbing
interest, that one is greatly tempted to digress and to
mention them in some detail. However, they have been
summarised and discussed by many able writers (see
Appendix III, ii.), and it must suffice here to refer simply
to the main points in which they bear upon the story of
the Labyrinth.</p>

<p>After about two months' work, with a staff of from
80 to 150 men, about two acres of the remains of a great
prehistoric building, showing strong evidence of having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
been destroyed by fire, were uncovered, and later excavations
showed that it was yet more extensive, covering
altogether about five acres. Not only this palace, but the
multitude of objects found within it, or associated with
it, were of surpassing importance in their bearing on the
nature of the ancient civilisation of which they demonstrated
the existence, and to which Sir A. Evans has
given the name "Minoan." Vast quantities of pottery
of widely different designs and workmanship, written
tablets, wall paintings&mdash;often of great beauty&mdash;reliefs,
and sculptured figures, shrines, seals, jewellery, a royal
gaming-board, and even a throne, were discovered as
the work went on, and eventually the whole area was
excavated down to the virgin rock, remains of an earlier
and smaller palace being found beneath the other, and
below this again a great thickness of deposits containing
many remains of neolithic man.</p>

<p>By means of occasional discoveries of imported Egyptian
objects, by comparison of Minoan pottery and paintings
with some found in Egyptian tombs, and by various
other indications, it was possible to date the upper remains,
say from 1580 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> onwards, fairly nearly. The
dating of the older remains is much more difficult, chiefly
because, although they can often be equated with certain
periods of Egyptian culture, the chronology of the latter
admits of widely different views, but it seems safe to say
that the earliest traces of the Minoan civilisation date
from quite 3000 years <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, and possibly many centuries
before that.</p>

<p>The earlier palace and town seem to have been built
before 2000 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> and destroyed a few centuries after that
date. The later palace was begun somewhere in the
eighteenth or nineteenth century <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, was elaborated in
succeeding centuries, and was sacked and burned, just
as it had attained the height of its glory, about 1400 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span></p>

<div id="ip_30" class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><img id="Fig_9" src="images/i_061.jpg" width="202" height="500" alt="" /><div class="caption"><p>Fig. 9. Double Axe and Stepped Steatite Socket from
Dictaean Cave. (Psychro)</p>

<p>(From <i>Archæologia</i>, by kind permission of the Society of
Antiquaries, and Sir Arthur Evans)</p></div></div>

<p>The discovery of this palace was one of the first-class
"finds" of archaeology. Those who based their estimates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
of the architectural capabilities of ancient Crete on their
knowledge of the development of the builder's art in
classic Greece, a millennium later, were amazed to find
that in many respects the product of the older civilisation
was superior.</p>

<p>To mention but a few of the most remarkable facts
about the palace, it was of <i>several storeys</i>, grouped around
a central court and pierced by "light-wells"; it contained
several staircases, one of them at least being of a very
imposing character and composed of <i>many flights</i>. Moreover,
it possessed a quite modern system of drainage,
with <i>jointed underground pipes</i> and with inspection manholes
to the main drains. Along the west side of the basement
ran a long straight gallery flanked by a series of
great storage-rooms or magazines. It was near one end of
this gallery that Dr. Evans discovered a store of tablets
with pictographic inscriptions, in proof of his suspicion
that the Phoenician script was not the original parent of
European written language.</p>

<p>Not far from this spot was the room containing the
throne (or Worshipful Master's Chair, as the masonic Dr.
Churchward prefers to call it) which may actually have
been occupied by King Minos.</p>

<p>A definite distinction can be recognised between
state and domestic apartments and subsidiary offices and
workshops.</p>

<p>To the north-west of the palace was a "stepped
theatral area" (<i>orchestra</i>), which suggests the "dancing
ground" of Ariadne.</p>

<p>From the point of view of our subject, however, the
most interesting features were the frequent occurrence
of the sign of the double axe, which was obviously an
object of great importance in Minoan worship, and the
profusion of evidence concerning the cult of the bull. On
the fallen plaster of one of the walls of a corridor, too,
was a repeated meander pattern, painted in red on a
white ground, very suggestive of a sort of maze (<a href="#Fig_8">Fig.&nbsp;8</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
The significance of the axe symbol from our point
of view lies in its bearing on the derivation of the word
"labyrinth," a question that will be referred to in rather
more detail in a later chapter.</p>

<p>One room of the palace, a stately hall about 80 ft.
in length by 26 ft. in breadth, traversed by a row of
square-sectioned pillars, has been named by its discoverer
"the Hall of the Double Axes," from the frequent occurrence
of this symbol therein. Not only does the sacred
axe occur as a more or less crude engraving on the stone
blocks composing certain pillars in the palace, but little
models of it were found associated with an altar, and, in
the Dictaean cave, some miles distant, several bronze
specimens of the axe were discovered in circumstances
which show that they were votive offerings. Sometimes
the sacred symbol was set up on a socketed pedestal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>(<a href="#Fig_9">Fig.&nbsp;9</a>). Moreover, in more recent excavations a curious
"tomb" was found (<a href="#Fig_10">Figs.&nbsp;10</a> and <a href="#Fig_11">11</a>) which was double-axe
shaped in plan and was evidently the repository of a
giant emblem (<a href="#Fig_12">Fig.&nbsp;12</a>. See plate, p. 42).</p>

in which relics were found.</p>

<p>(<i>From "Archaeologia," by kind permission of the Society of Antiquaries
and Sir Arthur Evans.</i>)</p></div></div>

<p>Long before Dr. Evans' excavations in Crete the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
German archaeologist Schliemann, during his researches
at Mycenae on the mainland, unearthed from one of the
graves an ox-head of gold plate, with a double axe between
the upright horns. The double axe was also the
sign of the Zeus worshipped at Labraunda in Caria, a
country to the north-east of Crete, on the mainland of
Asia Minor, where the implement was known as the
<i>labrys</i>.</p>

<p>The cult of the bull was also much in evidence in the
palace remains. Schliemann, in excavating the site of
Tiryns in 1884, came across an extraordinary wall-painting
depicting a man holding one horn of a great
bull whilst he leaps over its back, the animal meanwhile
charging at full speed. Several examples of such scenes
have since been discovered, painted upon walls, engraved
on gems, or stamped on seal-impressions. Amongst the
debris of one of the rooms in the palace at Knossos was
found a painting of a scene in which two girls are engaged
in dodging the charge of a bull, whilst a boy, who
has evidently just left hold of its horns, turns a somersault
over its back.</p>

<p>Near the main north entrance to the palace was
brought to light a large plaster relief of a bull's head, no
doubt originally forming part of the complete beast.
This relief was a masterpiece of Minoan art. It was of
life-size and beautifully coloured, and particular attention
had been given to the modelling and colour of
the eye, the fierce stare of which, in conjunction with
the open mouth, conveys a fine effect of frenzied
excitement.</p>

<p>These are only a few examples, amongst many, which
go to demonstrate that the sport of "bull-leaping"&mdash;or
ταυροκαθαψια [Greek: taurokathapsia], as it was called by the Greeks&mdash;was
beloved of the Minoans and was probably practised in
the precincts of the palace.</p>

<p>In the light of these discoveries Dr. Evans concludes
that the palace of Knossos was the Labyrinth, or House<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
of the Labrys, which gave rise to the classic legend, the
idea of the Minotaur originating in the practice of training
captives to participate in the dangerous sport of bull-leaping.
(<i>Tauros</i> = bull, hence <i>Minotaur</i> = Bull of Minos.)
We will refer further to the etymology of "labyrinth" in
a later chapter. The palace was certainly of sufficient
complexity to render it difficult for the uninitiated to
find their way about it, but the plan of its remains exhibits
no resemblance to a designed labyrinth of the conventional
type. There is, however, a suggestion of the
latter in the meander pattern painted on one of the walls,
to which reference has been made above. The notion as
to the Labyrinth having been a prison from which escape
was impossible may also have some connection with
two deep pits beneath the palace, whose function was
possibly that of dungeons for prisoners.</p>

<p>In considering the origin of the legend, we must remember
that a period of several centuries elapsed between
the destruction of the Knossian buildings and the first
written account of the Labyrinth, and must take into
account the probability that the people who in later ages
became the dominant race in Crete would be likely to
make ample use of their imagination in formulating an
explanation of the vast and complicated ruins of the
burnt city, with their mysterious frescoes and enigmatic
symbols.</p>

<p>It may also be borne in mind that the excavations in
Crete have by no means reached a final stage, and that,
although no architectural remains of a plan conforming
to the usual conception of a formal labyrinth are yet
forthcoming, there is a possibility that something of the
kind may yet turn up, though indeed the chance seems
very remote. Even as this book is going to press
appears an article in <i>The Times</i> by Sir Arthur Evans
announcing yet further enthralling discoveries; he finds
abundant signs of a great earthquake, causing ruin over
the whole Knossian area, about 1600 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, also evidence&mdash;including<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
portable altars and huge ox-skulls&mdash;indicating
an expiatory sacrifice recalling Homer's
words, "in bulls doth the Earthshaker delight"; and
finally, on a floor-level about thirty feet down, the opening
of an artificial cave with three rough steps leading
down to what was apparently the lair of some great
beast. "But here, perhaps," says Sir Arthur, "it is
better for imagination to draw rein."</p>

<span class="subhead">THE ETRUSCAN OR ITALIAN LABYRINTH</span></h2>

<p>In addition to the Egyptian and Cretan labyrinths, a few
other structures are referred to as being in the same
category, but not until a fairly late period.</p>

<p>Pliny (died <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 79) mentions one built by Smilis of
Aegina, after the Egyptian model, on the island of Lemnos,
and says that it was renowned for the beauty of its
150 columns and that remains of it existed in his time.
He also mentions one at Samos, said to have been built
by Theodorus, and says that "all of these buildings are
covered with arched roofs of polished stone." No other
details concerning these edifices have come down to us,
but Pliny quotes from Varro (116&ndash;27 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>) a detailed
description of a very extraordinary tomb at Clusium
(the modern Chiusi), said to be that of the great Etruscan
general Lars Porsena. This is the only Etruscan tomb
described by the ancient writers, and is mentioned by
Pliny solely because it was alleged to contain a subterranean
labyrinth. It must have been a most elaborate, not
to say extravagant, monument. Even Pliny feels some
qualms about accepting responsibility for the description,
and therefore makes it clear that he is simply quoting
from information received.</p>

<p>"It is but right that I should mention it," he says,
"in order to show that the vanity displayed by foreign
princes, great though it is, has been surpassed. But in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
view of the exceedingly fabulous nature of the story I
shall use the words given by M. Varro himself in his
account of it: 'Porsena was buried below the city of
Clusium in the place where he had built a square monument
of dressed stones. Each side was three hundred
feet in length and fifty in height, and beneath the base
there was an inextricable labyrinth, into which, if anybody
entered without a clue of thread, he could never
discover his way out. Above this square building there
stand five pyramids, one at each corner and one in the
centre, seventy-five feet broad at the base and one hundred
and fifty feet high. These pyramids so taper in
shape that upon the top of all of them together there is
supported a brazen globe, and upon that again a <span class="locked">petasus<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></span>
from which bells are suspended by chains. These make a
tinkling sound when blown about by the wind, as was done
in bygone times at Dodona. Upon this globe there are
four more pyramids, each a hundred feet in height, and
above them is a platform on which are five more pyramids.'
The height of the latter, Varro is ashamed to add,
but, according to the Etruscan stories, it was equal to
that of the rest of the building. What utter madness is
this, to attempt to seek glory at a great cost which can
never be of use to anyone; not to mention the drain upon
the resources of the country. And all to the end that the
artist may receive the greater share of the praise!"</p>

<p>There have been many discussions as to the possibility
of a monument of this nature having existed, and
various reconstructions have been attempted, notably
one (<a href="#Fig_13">Fig.&nbsp;13</a>), based on Varro's account, by a celebrated
French scholar of a century ago, M. Quatremère de
Quincy.</p>

<div id="ip_38" class="figcenter" style="width: 337px;"><img id="Fig_13" src="images/i_072.jpg" width="337" height="500" alt="" /><div class="caption"><p>Fig. 13. Tomb of Lars Porsena at Clusium.</p>

<p>Conjectural restoration by Quatremère de Quincy after Varro's description.</p></div></div>

<p>One enthusiast, a certain Father Angelo Cortenovis,
even wrote a treatise to prove that the whole contrivance
was nothing more nor less than a huge electrical machine!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
Most writers on the subject have been inclined to look
upon Varro's description as at best a gross exaggeration,
but Professor Müller gave it as his opinion that
the labyrinth described did actually exist, and that
the upper part, though no doubt highly embellished in
the description, was not the mere offspring of fancy.
He thought it quite probable that there was a square
basement of regular masonry supporting five pyramids
as recounted by Varro, but that the latter described the
upper part from hearsay. He drew attention to the fact
that a tomb somewhat of this nature is still in existence
on the Appian Way at Albano, the pyramids being represented
in this case by cones. It is commonly called
the Tomb of the Horatii and Curiatii.</p>

<p>In the early part of last century a British traveller,
G. Dennis, made a study of the antiquities of Etruria
and gave particular attention to the remarkable rock-cut
labyrinths of which that province furnishes several
examples.</p>

<p>He pointed out that the possession of a labyrinth was
the distinguishing feature of Porsena's tomb which
alone caused Pliny to mention it. The expression "Sub
Clusio" used by Pliny, he says, led subsequent writers
to infer that the subterranean passages beneath Chiusi
were intended, but such an arrangement would be at
variance with the general sepulchral practice of the
Etruscans, and the tomb of Porsena must be looked for
outside the city walls. Dennis then goes on to describe the
great cemetery that had recently been discovered in the
hill called Poggio Gajella, about three miles to the north-east
of Chiusi. His sketch of the principal "storey" of
this labyrinthine excavation is shown in <a href="#Fig_14">Fig.&nbsp;14</a>.</p>

<p>Here again we may note that the design of the passages,
although perhaps puzzling to a stranger, especially
with imperfect illumination, in no respect approaches
the traditional "labyrinth" pattern. That the conventional
form was not unknown to the Etruscans, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
is shown by the occurrence of a design of this type on
a vase found at Tragliatella which we shall mention
later.</p>

<p>It is, of course, possible that the tomb of Porsena was
erected on the hill above this labyrinth, but we have not
much evidence on the point. If the tomb possessed a
labyrinth, no doubt the latter would have been something
of this type. Dennis also mentions various other
labyrinths of this nature in Etruria&mdash;for example, one
near Volterra, "a long passage cut in the rock, six feet
wide but only three high, so that you must travel on
all-fours. From time to time the passage widens into
chambers, yet not high enough to permit you to stand
upright, or it meets the passages of similar character
opening in various directions and extending into the heart
of the hill, how far no one can say. In short, this is a
perfect labyrinth in which, without a clue, one might
very soon be lost."</p>

<p>He also mentions one at San Pietro, Toscanella, "in
the cliffs below the Madonna dell' Olivo, about half a
mile from the town. Here a long, sewer-like passage
leads into a spacious chamber of irregular form, with
two massive columns supporting its ceiling and a rude
pilaster on the wall behind. But the peculiarity of the
tomb lies in a <i>cuniculus</i> or passage cut in the rock, just
large enough for a man to creep through on all-fours,
which, entering the wall on one side after a long gyration
and sundry branchings, now blocked with earth,
opens in the opposite wall of the tomb."</p>

<div id="ip_40" class="figcenter" style="width: 460px;"><img id="Fig_14" src="images/i_076.jpg" width="460" height="500" alt="" /><div class="caption">Fig. 14. Poggio Cajella. Labyrinthine Cemetery. (Dennis)</div></div>

<p>These Etruscan labyrinths were all of a sepulchral
character, and one is naturally reminded of the catacombs
of Rome, Paris, and Naples, to which, however, the term
"labyrinth" is not customarily applied. Strabo uses the
word in reference to a catacomb near Nauplia, which he
calls the Labyrinth of the Cyclops. In Pliny's time the
word would appear to have been used to denote a winding
path following a more or less formal design of intricate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
pattern, but not necessarily connected with sepulchral
purposes.</p>

<p>When speaking of the Labyrinth of Crete he says, "We
must not compare this to what we see traced upon our
<i>mosaic pavements</i> or to the <i>mazes formed in the fields</i> for
the entertainment of children, and thus suppose it to be
a narrow path along which we may walk for many miles
together, but we must picture to ourselves an edifice with
many doors and galleries which mislead the visitor...."
This passage shows that the term "labyrinth" had come
to have a fairly broad significance. It had long been used
in a metaphorical sense, even as we find Plato, over four
centuries earlier, employing it to describe an elaborate
argument. We also find it applied by extension to other
objects, such as traps for fish, to judge by a certain
passage in the works of Theocritus.</p>

<p>The only buildings to which the ancient writers applied
the term, however, were those to which we have
already referred.</p>

<p>Of the two phrases which we have italicised in the
above quotation from Pliny, the second is of interest in
connection with a matter we shall deal with later on,
whilst the former brings us to the subject of our next
chapter.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE LABYRINTH IN ANCIENT ART</span></h2>

<p>There has been considerable speculation as to how the
typical labyrinth form first came into existence. It became
stereotyped long before the Christian era and retained
its character for many centuries.</p>

<div id="ip_42" class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img id="Fig_12" src="images/i_081.jpg" width="500" height="178" alt="" /><div class="caption"><p>Fig. 12. Bronze Double Axe from Tomb of the Double Axes.<br />

<p>The coins of Knossos furnish us with abundant examples
of it, and, from the fact that in certain of the
earlier specimens the corresponding figure is a simple
repeated meander, it has been supposed that the typical
labyrinth design arose by elaboration of the meander.
The resemblance between this form and the very widespread
and primitive sign known as the <i>fylfot</i> or <i>svastika</i>
has also attracted some attention. It is a somewhat long
step, however, from a loose combination of meanders like
that shown in, say, <a href="#Fig_20">Fig.&nbsp;20</a>, to the compact conventional
labyrinth of <a href="#Fig_26">Fig.&nbsp;30</a>. The adoption of the former design
may possibly have been inspired by the fresco on one of
the walls of the Minoan palace, to which we have made
reference in Chapter VI (<a href="#Fig_8">Fig.&nbsp;8</a>), portions of which
may have been visible among the ruins for several
generations. There does not appear to be any evidence
that the complex meander pattern of the fresco was an
allusion on the part of the Minoans to an actual constructional
labyrinth; it may quite well have been a purely
ornamental conception, without any symbolical significance.
Meander designs were used by the Minoans at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
much earlier date than this, one example, though of
simpler character, having been found in the older palace,
and others, either snake-like or of a squarish nature, on
ivory seals unearthed at other Minoan sites (Zakro and
Hagia Triada). Similar designs exist on certain Egyptian
"button-seals" of an approximately contemporary
period&mdash;from the VIth Dynasty onwards&mdash;and Sir
Arthur Evans has expressed the opinion that these will
possibly prove to constitute the source of the Labyrinth
in Art. <a href="#Fig_15">Figs.&nbsp;15, 16, 17, 18</a> show
specimens of early Egyptian seals
and plaques of this character in
the British Museum. Professor
Flinders Petrie very kindly drew
the writer's attention to a steatite
plaque in his collection at University
College, London, which is
somewhat similar to one of those
mentioned above, but of rather
more elaborate design (<a href="#Fig_19">Fig.&nbsp;19</a>).
The labyrinthine pattern on this
is surmounted by a representation,
in the peculiar "linear" fashion
often adopted by early Egyptian
artists, of two seated human
figures facing one another, the
knees being drawn up. Professor Petrie acquired the
plaque at Memphis. He considers that it dates from a
period round about 3000 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, and points out that if the
broken lines be completed there would appear to be five
false turns to be avoided before reaching the centre.</p>

<div id="ip_43" class="figcenter" style="width: 332px;"><img id="Fig_19" src="images/i_082.jpg" width="332" height="500" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 19.</span>&mdash;Early Egyptian
Plaque or Amulet.
(Prof. Petrie's Collection,
University College, London.)</div></div>

<p>In discussing the designs on these seals and plaques,
Sir A. Evans alludes to a possible connection with two
of the hieroglyphs of the period, which are of the nature
of simple square meanders of a kind extensively employed
in ancient ornament. One of them (<i>mer</i>) is the
sign used for indicating irrigated land. The other (<i>aha</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
is a simplified form of a more elaborate sign representing
the plan of a palace court, a figure to which one of the
Minoan signs bears a close resemblance.</p>

<p>The Knossian coins shown in <a href="#Fig_20">Figs.&nbsp;20</a> to <a href="#Fig_26">31</a> are from
the British Museum collection and are reproduced by
the courtesy of the Keeper of the Coins and Medals Department,
who supplied the writer with plaster casts for
the purpose. They date, of course, from times greatly
posterior to those of the Minoan civilisation, from times
when the culture of Greece had long replaced that of the
Mycenaeans, or whatever similar race it was that succeeded
the Minoans (see Appendix IV, i.).</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_20">Figs.&nbsp;20, 21, and 22</a> show silver coins dating from
about 500 to 430 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> They portray on one side the
Minotaur and on the other a symmetrical meander
pattern which, it needs very little imagination to see, has
reference to the labyrinth in which the monster was
alleged to dwell.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_20">Fig.&nbsp;23</a> shows a silver coin of a rather later date, representing
on its obverse a female head which is thought
to be that of Demeter or Persephone, and on the reverse
a meander-labyrinth containing a star at its centre.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_20">Fig.&nbsp;24</a> shows a similar obverse, but on the reverse we
see a bull's head surrounded by a simple meander frame.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_20">Fig.&nbsp;25</a>, the obverse of which is likewise adorned with
a female head, gives on the reverse the design of a square
labyrinth of the conventional type that thereafter predominates.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_26">Fig.&nbsp;26</a> shows a bronze coin having on one side the
head of Apollo and on the other a labyrinth with a star.</p>

<p>The four coins last described date from a period
between 430 and 350 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> The next (<a href="#Fig_26">Fig.&nbsp;27</a>) is rather
later in date and shows on its obverse the head of Hera
and on the reverse a square labyrinth together with an
arrow-head and thunderbolts and the Greek characters
ΚΝΩΣΙΩΝ [Greek: KNÔSIÔN].</p>

<div id="ip_44" class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img id="Fig_20" src="images/i_084.jpg" width="500" height="335" alt="" /><div class="caption">Figs. 20 to 25. Coins of Knossos. (British Museum)</div></div>

<p>The bronze coin of about 220 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, shown in <a href="#Fig_26">Fig.&nbsp;28</a>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
bears on its obverse the figure of Europa seated on a bull,
with two dolphins below, and on the reverse a square
labyrinth, the Knossian superscription being again
evident.</p>

<p>The remaining three figures represent silver coins of
the two succeeding centuries, but not later than 67 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span></p>

<p><a href="#Fig_26">Fig.&nbsp;29</a> exhibits on one side the head of Pallas, and
on the reverse a little square labyrinth placed beside an
owl standing upon a prostrate amphora.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Fig_26">Fig.&nbsp;30</a> the obverse is occupied by the head of
Apollo, the reverse by a labyrinth of circular shape, but
conforming to the conventional plan.</p>

<p>The head on the coin shown in <a href="#Fig_26">Fig.&nbsp;31</a> may be intended
for that of Minos or Zeus. On the reverse is a
square labyrinth.</p>

<p>Labyrinthine designs are also found on certain Lydian,
Phrygian, and Ionian coins.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that when once the labyrinth pattern
has been definitely conventionalised it remains very constant
in principle, whether its general conformation be
rectangular or circular. Starting from the exterior, the
"path" runs inwards a short distance, turns so as to run
parallel with the outer wall until nearly a full circuit has
been completed, then doubles back on itself and runs
round in the opposite direction, doubles upon itself
again, and so on until it finally comes to a stop in a blind
end, having traversed all of the space within the outer
walls without covering any part twice and without forming
any branches or loops.</p>

<p>Obviously there is no "puzzle" about this kind of
labyrinth; one has simply to follow the one path, either to
penetrate to the inner goal or to escape thence to the
exterior.</p>

<p>A labyrinth of precisely this type was discovered
traced on the surface of a crimson-painted pillar in the
peristyle of the building known as the House of Lucretius,
in the excavated portion of Pompeii (<a href="#Fig_32">Fig.&nbsp;32</a>). It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
was evidently scratched with a nail or stylus by some
idler of 2000 years ago (Pompeii was overwhelmed by
Vesuvius in <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 79) and is accompanied by the words
"<span class="smcap smaller">LABYRINTHUS. HIC HABITAT MINOTAURUS</span>," possibly in
waggish reference to the owner or occupier of the
premises.</p>

<div id="ip_46" class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img id="Fig_32" src="images/i_087.jpg" width="500" height="275" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 32.</span>&mdash;<i>Graffito</i> at Pompeii. (Museo Borbonico.)</div></div>

<p>Another house has, in consequence of its mosaic and
pictorial references to the Cretan Labyrinth, received the
name of the Casa del Labirinto or House of the Labyrinth.
One mosaic discovered therein depicts Theseus
and the Minotaur struggling on the ground, watched by
a group of affrighted maidens.</p>

<p>The Romans excelled in the art of designing and
executing mosaic pavements, abundant remains of which
have been preserved. These were of various kinds. There
was the <i>pavimentum sectile</i>, composed of pieces of marble
of various sizes, shapes, and colours arranged in uniform
sets, so as to form when put together an ornamental pattern;
the <i>pavimentum tessellatum</i>, in which the pieces of
marble, though variously coloured, were all of the same
size and shape, generally small squares; the <i>pavimentum
vermiculatum,</i> composed of very small pieces of coloured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
marble of irregular shape so arranged as to portray
objects in their natural shapes and colours; and finally the
<i>pavimentum scalpturatum</i>, in which the design was engraved
or inlaid. <i>Opus alexandrinum</i> is a variant of <i>sectile</i>.</p>

<div id="ip_47" class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img id="Fig_33" src="images/i_090.jpg" width="500" height="387" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 33.</span>&mdash;Mosaic at Salzburg. (Kreuzer.)</div></div>

<p>Several Roman pavements embodying labyrinthine
devices, and in some cases commemorating the victory
of Theseus over the Minotaur, or other exploits of
the hero, have come to light from time to time, not
only on the continent of Europe but also in England;
they are usually executed in <i>opus alexandrinum</i>.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_33">Fig.&nbsp;33</a> shows in outline a beautiful specimen, 18 ft.
long and 15 ft. broad, discovered at Salzburg, in Austria.
It bears the device of a labyrinth, with, at the centre, a
representation of Theseus about to give the fatal blow to
the Minotaur.</p>

<p>On the left side we see Theseus and Ariadne joining
hands over the altar. In the upper panel Theseus appears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
to be putting Ariadne ashore, and to the right we see the
disconsolate maiden deserted by her lover, presumably
on the Isle of Naxos.</p>

<p>A labyrinth of the type shown also occurs on a Roman
mosaic which was unearthed in the churchyard at
Caerleon-on-Usk. It was in a poor state of preservation,
but sufficient remains to show that the labyrinth, of a
design similar to that of the Salzburg specimen, is surrounded
by scrolls proceeding from two vases (<a href="#Fig_34">Fig.&nbsp;34</a>).</p>

<p>A very fine specimen of this type of labyrinth was discovered
in 1904 beneath a ploughed field at Harpham,
in the East Riding of Yorkshire. Another, of which
details are not to hand, is said to have been found in
Northamptonshire.</p>

<p>In 1790 a pavement, about eighteen feet by twelve,
was unearthed at Aix, near Marseilles. It portrayed the
combat between Theseus and the Minotaur, within a
framed square, the remainder of the mosaic consisting
of a complicated interlaced meander representing the
labyrinth.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Fig_35">Fig.&nbsp;35</a> is reproduced from A. de Caumont's
"Abécédaire d'Archéologie" a rough sketch of the
Roman baths at Verdes (Loir-et-Cher), showing a pavement
with a labyrinth mosaic.</p>

<p>A pavement found in 1830 at Cormerod, in the Canton
of Friburg, Switzerland, is shown in <a href="#Fig_36">Fig.&nbsp;36</a>. A few
years afterwards another was brought to light in the
neighbouring Canton of Vaud, from beneath the ruins
of the ancient town of Orbe.</p>

<p>A splendid mosaic labyrinth of Roman times was
found some forty or fifty years ago on a family tomb in
the ancient necropolis of Susa, Tunis (<i>Hadrumetum</i>). It
was afterwards destroyed by looters, but a careful drawing
of it was fortunately made on its first discovery (<a href="#Fig_37">Fig.&nbsp;37</a>).
The whole mosaic measured about seventeen feet by
ten, and contained a very finely executed labyrinth of
four paths, like the Harpham and Caerleon examples<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
mentioned above, the central space being occupied by
the Minotaur, who is shown in an attitude of defeat.
Sailing towards the labyrinth was a boat containing
figures which presumably represented Theseus and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
companions. The design was accompanied by the words
"<span class="smcap smaller">HIC INCLUSUS VITAM PERDIT</span>."</p>

<div id="ip_50" class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img id="Fig_37" src="images/i_095.jpg" width="500" height="305" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 37.</span>&mdash;Mosaic at Susa, Tunis. (C.&nbsp;R. Acad. Inscriptions, Paris.)</div></div>

<p>Another well-preserved mosaic of this character was
discovered in 1884 at Brindisi, and placed in the municipal
museum of that town. It measures 17 ft. by 10 ft.
6 in., and shows within a square labyrinth Theseus in
the act of clubbing the Minotaur, who has fallen on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
knees. Around the labyrinth are various perches with
birds thereon, perhaps in allusion to the automatic birds
reputed to have been made by Daedalus (<i>cf.</i> <a href="#Fig_36">Fig.&nbsp;36</a>).</p>

<p>We shall examine other mosaic and pavement labyrinths
when we come to consider the question of the use
of this symbol by the Church.</p>

<p>Apart from the designs on Knossian coins, Greek art
does not appear to have left us any definite representations
of the labyrinths, although with the Romans, who
acquired the idea at a later date, it was a favourite <i>motif</i>.</p>

<p>We cannot, however, ignore the suggestion that has
been made that certain structures discovered in the ruins
of Tiryns and Epidaurus, two cities in that part of
ancient Greece known as the Argolid, are architectural
labyrinths, used for ritual purposes. The foundations of
the <i>tholos</i>, or rotunda, of the sanctuary of Aesculapius at
Epidaurus, which was excavated by P. Kabbadias, Director
of the Greek Archaeological Society, in the 'eighties,
do certainly suggest something of the kind. They consist
of concentric circular walls, the three innermost being
connected by a radial wall, separated by narrow spaces
which intercommunicate by an opening or doorway in
each wall, forming in plan a figure somewhat in the style
of the "Pigs in Clover" toy mentioned in a later chapter.
When the peculiar nature of the upper part of the building
is considered, however, it seems very reasonable to
suppose that these walls, with their passages, were designed
only with a view to the requirements of the
superstructure which they had to support.</p>

<p>As for the slightly similar concentric foundations unearthed
by German excavators at Tiryns in 1912, the
analogy is too imperfect to afford reliable grounds for the
statement in question.</p>

<p>Greek ceramic art, on the other hand, furnishes us with
very many allusions to the Theseus-Minotaur myth, and
also with a profusion of frets and meanders, which are
thought in some cases to be symbolical of the labyrinth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
Consider, for instance, the "<i>kylix</i>" or bowl in the British
Museum which is shown in <a href="#Fig_38">Fig.&nbsp;38</a>. (A similar bowl is
preserved in Harrow School Museum.) On it are represented
most of the exploits of the hero up to his Knossian
adventure. All who are familiar with the legend will
recognise at a glance Periphetes the Club-bearer, Sinis
the Pine-bender, the Wild Sow of Krommyon, Kerkyon
the Wrestler, Procrustes of the Standard Bed, and other
gentlefolk that Theseus successively encountered and appropriately
dealt with on his initial journey to Athens. In
the centre of the bowl is shown the adventure of the
Labyrinth, the hero being seen in the act of despatching
the monster at the very door of his lair. The meander on
the door-post has been thought to symbolise the Labyrinth,
but there is more reason to suppose that it is
purely decorative.</p>

<p>The Minotaur exploit is also shown on the smaller
bowl shown in <a href="#Fig_38">Fig.&nbsp;39</a>.</p>

<p>In the previous chapter we have already referred to
an Etruscan vase found at Tragliatella. This was very
roughly decorated with incised figures, representing
amongst other things a circular labyrinth of the traditional
type and some horsemen who are thought to be engaged
either in the attack on Troy or in the game known as the
<i>Lusus Trojae</i> or Game of Troy. That there can be no
doubt about the artist's identification of the labyrinth in
some way with the celebrated city in question is clear
from the word <i>Truia</i> scratched within it (<a href="#Fig_133">Fig.&nbsp;133</a>).</p>

<p>Representations of the labyrinth were sometimes engraved
on ancient gems, a fine specimen of which is
figured in P.&nbsp;A. Maffei's "Gemme Antiche" (<a href="#Fig_40">Fig.&nbsp;40</a>),
published in 1707. The Minotaur in this case is shown
as a centaur. A similar representation appears on a sixteenth-century
bronze plaquette of Italian workmanship
exhibited in the Plaquette Room at the British Museum
(<a href="#Fig_41">Fig.&nbsp;41</a>. See plate, p. 60).</p>

<p>Before leaving the subject of the Labyrinth in ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
art we must take notice of a reference in an ancient manuscript
which tends to show that the symbol figured on
the robes of Roman Emperors. This manuscript was
discovered by A.&nbsp;F. Ozanam in the Laurentian Library
at Florence. It is entitled "Graphia Aurea Urbis
Romae" and contains, under the heading "De diarodino
imperatoris," the following passage:</p>

<p><i>Habeat et in diarodino laberinthum fabrefactum ex auro
et margaritis, in quo sit Minotaurus, digitum ad os tenens ex
smaragdo factus, quia sicut non valet quis laberinthum scrutare,
ita non debet consilium dominatoris propalare.</i></p>

<p>"Let there be represented on it (the Emperor's robe)
a labyrinth of gold and pearls, in which is the Minotaur,
made of emerald, holding his finger to his mouth, thus
signifying that, just as none may know the secret of the
labyrinth, so none may reveal the monarch's counsels."</p>

<span class="subhead">CHURCH LABYRINTHS</span></h2>

<p>The consideration of labyrinths worked in Roman mosaic
pavements leads us on to a very interesting development
of the subject which deserves a chapter to itself, namely,
the Labyrinth in the Church.</p>

<p>Probably the oldest known example of this nature is
that in the ancient basilica of <i>Reparatus</i> at Orléansville
(Algeria), an edifice which is believed to date from the
fourth century <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> In the pavement near the north-west
entrance of the church is the design shown in outline in
<a href="#Fig_42">Fig.&nbsp;42</a>. It measures about 8 ft. in diameter and shows
great resemblance to the Roman pavement found at
Harpham and the tomb-mosaic at Susa. At the centre
is a <i>jeu-de-lettres</i> on the words <span class="smcap smaller">SANCTA ECLESIA</span>, which may
be read in any direction, except diagonally, commencing
at the centre. But for the employment of these words the
labyrinth in question might well have been conceived to
be a Roman relic utilised by the builders of the church
to ornament their pavement. Such pavement-labyrinths,
however, with or without central figures or other embellishments,
and of various dimensions and composition,
are found in many of the old churches of France and
Italy.</p>

<p>They seem to have been constructed chiefly during
the twelfth century, and although several of them have
been destroyed many fine examples still remain. Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
are formed on the walls instead of the pavements, and in
such cases are of smaller dimensions.</p>

<div id="ip_56" class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img id="Fig_44" src="images/i_103.jpg" width="500" height="217" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 44.</span>&mdash;Labyrinth in S. Michele, Pavia. (Ciampini.)</div></div>

<p>On the whole, too, those in the Italian churches are
much smaller than the French specimens. On the wall of
Lucca Cathedral (<a href="#Fig_43">Fig.&nbsp;43</a>) is one of a diameter of only
1 ft. 7½ in. It formerly enclosed at the centre a representation
of Theseus and the Minotaur, but owing to the
friction of many generations of tracing fingers this has
become effaced. Opposite the "entrance" is the inscription:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i0">HIC QUEM CRETICUS EDIT</span>
<span class="i0">DAEDALUS EST LABERINTHUS,</span>

<span class="i0">NI THESEUS GRATIS ADRIANE</span>
<span class="i0">STAMINE JUTUS.</span>
</div></div>

<p>A similar small labyrinth, with a central Theseus-Minotaur
design, is to be found on the wall of the church
of San Michele Maggiore at Pavia (<a href="#Fig_44">Fig.&nbsp;44</a>). It is thought
to be of tenth-century construction. This is one of the
few cases where the Minotaur is represented with a
human head and a beast's body&mdash;as a sort of Centaur, in
fact. It is accompanied by the words "<span class="smcap smaller">TESEUS INTRAVIT
MONSTRUMQUE BIFORME NECAVIT</span>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
Of about the same period was the example in the
church of San Savino at Piacenza. It is described by
P.&nbsp;M. Campi in his "Ecclesiastical History of Piacenza"
(1651), under the year <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 903. The signs of the Zodiac
were placed in juxtaposition to it. The accompanying
legend in this case consisted of four hexameters, to the
effect that the labyrinth represented the world we live in,
broad at the entrance, but narrow at the exit, so that he
who is ensnared by the joys of this world, and weighed
down by his vices, can regain the doctrine of life only
with difficulty.</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem intact">

<p>In the Cathedral of Cremona, which, like Pavia and
Piacenza, is on the banks of the River Po, is a mutilated
mosaic of early date&mdash;possibly eighth or ninth century&mdash;showing
part of an interlaced pattern which was evidently
intended to refer to the Cretan Labyrinth, as it was placed
close to two figures in fighting attitudes and armed with
swords and shields, the right-hand figure having the
head of a beast and the label "<span class="smcap smaller">CENTAVRVS</span>." (There was
apparently little distinction between a Minotaur and a
Centaur in the minds of some mediaeval artists.)</p>

<p>A rather larger specimen, 5 ft. in diameter, may be
seen in the church of Sta. Maria-in-Aquiro, Rome. It is
composed of bands of porphyry and yellow and green
marble, surrounding a central plate of porphyry, and is
similar in design to that at Lucca. Another church in the
same city, Sta. Maria-di-Trastavera, has a labyrinth composed
of variously coloured marbles worked in the floor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
It is 11 ft. across and was probably constructed about
1190 <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> (<a href="#Fig_45">Fig.&nbsp;45</a>). It is now somewhat mutilated, but
was originally a most beautiful example. The fact that
the inner paths consist of a series of concentric rings
rather suggests that it has at some time been repaired
without regard to the original design; unless we accept
the hypothesis of M. Durand that they bore a symbolic
reference to the various degrees of beatitude by which
the soul approaches heaven, as figured by Dante. <a href="#Fig_46">Fig.&nbsp;46</a>
shows another old Italian specimen. It is nearly 11½ ft.
in diameter and is to be found in the church of San Vitale,
Ravenna.</p>

<p>Designs of this nature were widely employed by the
mediaeval church builders in France, and, although many
of them were destroyed at the Revolution and at other
times, several fine examples still exist. They seem to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
been mostly built at a rather later date than those already
described. The largest now remaining is that in Chartres
Cathedral (<a href="#Fig_47">Fig.&nbsp;47</a>). It is formed of blue and white stones
and is about 40 ft. in diameter. The French poet Bouthrays,
in his "Histoire de Chartres" (1624), describes it
in a set of Latin verses. A fine sketch of it appears in the
"Album" of the thirteenth-century architect, Villard de
Honnecourt. In a ninth-century French manuscript, formerly
belonging to the Abbey of St.-Germain-des-Prés,
there is a sort of frontispiece consisting of a labyrinth of
similar type, with a funny little horned Minotaur at the
centre, seated, hands on knees, on a kind of throne.</p>

<div id="ip_59" class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img id="Fig_48" src="images/i_108.jpg" width="500" height="500" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 48.</span>&mdash;Labyrinth in Amiens Cathedral. (Gailhabaud.)</div></div>

<p>The Chartres labyrinth formerly went by the name of
"La Lieue," an expression which would ordinarily be
rendered as "the league." The French league, however,
was about 2282 yards, a much greater length than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
total extent of the path in any of the existing pavement-labyrinths,
that at Chartres, for example, having a length
of only about 150 yards. Possibly the term had some
etymological connection with the old Gaulish measure
<i>leuca</i>, <i>leuga</i> or <i>leuva</i>, which was 1500 paces.</p>

<div id="ip_60" class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><img id="Fig_49" src="images/i_109.jpg" width="450" height="448" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 49.</span>&mdash;Labyrinth in Parish Church, St. Quentin. (Gailhabaud).</div></div>

<p>In other cases the labyrinth was known as a "<i>Chemin
de Jérusalem</i>," "<i>daedale</i>," or "<i>meandre</i>," terms which need
no explanation. The centre was called "<i>ciel</i>" or "<i>Jérusalem</i>."
The labyrinth formerly in the nave of Amiens
Cathedral was larger than that at Chartres, being 42 ft.
in diameter (<a href="#Fig_48">Fig.&nbsp;48</a>). It was constructed in 1288 and
was destroyed in 1825. In plan it was similar to that at
the entrance to the parish church of St. Quentin (<a href="#Fig_49">Fig.&nbsp;49</a>).
The latter, however, is only 34½ ft. in diameter.</p>

<p>Rheims Cathedral formerly possessed a fine design of
this class (<a href="#Fig_50">Fig.&nbsp;50</a>). It was laid down in 1240 and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
composed of blue stones or marbles. It was destroyed in
1779 by order of a certain Canon Jacquemart, who objected
to the noise made by children and others in tracing
its course during the progress of divine service.</p>

<p>The labyrinths of Rheims, Chartres, and Amiens
possessed in common a feature which has given rise
to much discussion, namely, a figure or figures at the
centre representing, it is believed, the architects of the
edifices.</p>

<p>That of Amiens is preserved in Amiens Museum and
consists of an octagonal grey marble slab (<a href="#Fig_51">Fig.&nbsp;51</a>) with
a central cross, between the limbs of which are arranged
figures representing Bishop Evrard and the three architects,
Robert de Luzarches, Thomas de Cormont and his
son Regnault, together with four angels. A long inscription
accompanied it, relating to the foundation of the
Cathedral.</p>

<p>There is a very fine labyrinth in the chapter-house of
Bayeux Cathedral (<a href="#Fig_52">Fig.&nbsp;52</a>). It measures 12 ft. across
and is composed of circles of tiles ornamented with
shields, griffins and fleur-de-lis, separated by bands of
small, plain, black tiles.</p>

<p>Sens Cathedral formerly possessed a circular labyrinth
(<a href="#Fig_53">Fig.&nbsp;53</a>), 30 ft. in diameter and formed of incised lines
filled in with lead, but it was destroyed in 1769. A similar
specimen in Auxerre Cathedral was demolished about
1690.</p>

<p>In <i>The Builder</i> for May 12, 1916, appeared a diagram
accompanied by a note from a firm of publishers who
stated that they had received the sketch from one of their
travellers who was then serving on the Arras front. "He
informs us," they state, "that it is not a puzzle, but a
plan of the labyrinth under the cathedral. He found the
prints in a ruin in the vicinity, a house which appears to
have been occupied by a librarian from what he saw
among the débris." The sketch in question is of an
octagonal pattern resembling that of the St. Quentin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
labyrinth, and represents the pavement-labyrinth that formerly
existed in the now ruined cathedral, not, of course,
a system of subterranean passages, as the correspondent
evidently inferred. It was about 34½ ft. in diameter and
was composed of small blue and yellow squares. The
destruction of this labyrinth cannot be debited to the
account of the aggressors in the Great War, as it was
carried out during the French Revolution.</p>

<p>A labyrinth of rather striking design (<a href="#Fig_54">Fig.&nbsp;54</a>) was
formerly in the pavement of the old Abbey of St. Bertin,
an edifice which has long been a picturesque ruin, in the
lower part of the town of St. Omer. A description of it
was first published nearly a century ago by Emmanuel
Wallet (or Vallet). Our figure, which accords with his
notes, differs slightly from that which has usually accompanied
the references of subsequent writers&mdash;many of
whom, by the way, erroneously speak of it as being in
the cathedral, which is in the upper part of the town, and
at some distance from St. Bertin. Most illustrations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
the labyrinth in question show the path as crossing itself
at one point, an arrangement which is most unlikely to
have been adopted. Wallet based his description on a
manuscript which, judging by the watermark in the paper,
he attributed to a former English student at the college
in the vicinity.</p>

<div id="ip_63" class="figcenter" style="width: 499px;"><img id="Fig_54" src="images/i_116.jpg" width="499" height="500" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 54.</span>&mdash;Labyrinth in Abbey of St. Bertin, St. Omer. (Wallet.)</div></div>

<p>This labyrinth was apparently destroyed at about the
same time as that at Rheims, and for a similar reason.</p>

<p>In the cathedral there is no pavement-labyrinth, although
it may possibly have possessed one in former
times, but beneath the organ, at the west end of the nave,
is a curiously engraved slab which is worth mentioning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
in this connection, for it represents a sort of "chemin de
Jérusalem," though not indeed of the usual type. It shows,
around a large circle, mountains, rivers, towns, roads,
and animals, together with the word <span class="smcap smaller">I</span>h<span class="smcap smaller">ERVSALEM</span>, whilst
the interior of the circle is divided into three horizontal
compartments, in each of which are placed various objects
indistinguishable through wear. The slab was very
much worn when described by Wallet and has possibly
been replaced by now.</p>

<div id="ip_64" class="figcenter" style="width: 447px;"><img id="Fig_55" src="images/i_117.jpg" width="447" height="500" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 55.</span>&mdash;Labyrinth in Poitiers Cathedral. (Auber.)</div></div>

<p>A queer type of labyrinth was formerly represented in
the Cathedral of Poitiers. It perished long ago, but for
some time subsequently there remained on the wall of the
north aisle a sketch of it (<a href="#Fig_55">Fig.&nbsp;55</a>), which, however, gave
no clue to the dimensions of the original. It will be seen
that the construction is such that he who traces the path
eventually emerges&mdash;like the poet of the "Rubaiyat"&mdash;by
that same door at which he entered; he will have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
encountered no "stops," but he may have "looped the
loop" an indefinite number of times.</p>

<p>In the old abbey of Toussaints, Châlons-sur-Marne,
which was destroyed in 1544, there was a series of tiles
each bearing a small labyrinth of the conventional Cretan
type (<a href="#Fig_56">Fig.&nbsp;56</a>. See plate, p. 74). Pavement-tiles with
labyrinths were also found in the Abbaye de Pont l'Abbé
(Finistère).</p>

<p>A pavement labyrinth has been described as existing
in the floor of the guard chamber of the Abbey of St.
Stephen at Caen. Dawson Turner, in his "Tour in Normandy,"
thus refers to it: "The floor is laid with tiles,
each near five inches square, baked almost to vitrification.
Eight rows of these tiles, running east to west, are
charged with different coats of arms, said to be those of
the families who attended Duke William in his invasion
of England. The intervals between these rows are filled
up with a kind of tessellated pavement, the middle whereof
represents a maze or labyrinth, about ten feet in diameter,
and so artfully contrived that, were we to suppose
a man following all the intricate meanders of the volutes,
he could not travel less than a mile before he got from
one end to the other. The remainder of the floor is inlaid
with small squares of different colours, placed alternately
and formed into draught or chess boards, for the amusement
of the soldiers while on guard." The pavement was
destroyed in 1802.</p>

<p>It has frequently been stated that a pavement labyrinth
existed in a church at Aix near Marseilles, but
probably this is due to confusion with the Roman pavement
already referred to.</p>

<p>The only examples recorded as having existed in Germany
were situated in two churches at Cologne, but
these have long since disappeared.</p>

<p>In view of the widespread occurrence of these devices
in mediaeval churches it would be surprising if the idea
were not sometimes utilised by modern architects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
attempting to reproduce the spirit of the old buildings,
and in fact this was done in the case of the prize plans
<span class="locked">submitted<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></span> by the English architects Clutton and Burges
for the Church of Notre-Dame de la Treille at Lille.
Burges designed for the nave a "Chemin de Jérusalem"
of a wonderful pattern, the topography of "Jerusalem"
being based upon the account in the "Ecclesiastical History"
of the Venerable Bede (V. ch. 16). A good modern
example, 20 ft. square, may be seen in the pavement of Ely
Cathedral, near the west door (<a href="#Fig_57">Fig.&nbsp;57</a>). It was constructed
by Sir Gilbert Scott during his restorations in 1870. Some
other modern specimens will be mentioned presently.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> These plans, although awarded the prize, were not
adopted, the designs actually carried out being some by a
native architect who obtained tenth place in the competition.</p></div>

<div id="ip_66" class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img id="Fig_57" src="images/i_119.jpg" width="500" height="499" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 57.</span>&mdash;Labyrinth in Ely Cathedral. (W.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;M.)</div></div>

<p>As to the function and meaning of the old church labyrinths,
various opinions have been held. Some authorities
have thought that they were merely introduced as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
symbol of the perplexities and intricacies which beset
the Christian's path. Others considered them to typify
the entangling nature of sin or of any deviation from the
rectilinear path of Christian duty. It has often been asserted,
though on what evidence is not clear, that the
larger examples were used for the performance of miniature
pilgrimages in substitution for the long and tedious
journeys formerly laid upon penitents. Some colour is
lent to this supposition by the name "Chemin de Jérusalem."
In the days of the first crusades it was a common
practice for the confessor to send the peccant members
of his flock either to fight against the infidel, or, after the
victory of Geoffrey of Bouillon, to visit the Holy Sepulchre.
As enthusiasm for the crusades declined, shorter
pilgrimages were substituted, usually to the shrine of
some saint, such as Our Lady of Loretto, or St. Thomas
of Canterbury, and it is quite possible that, at a time
when the soul had passed out of the crusades and the
Church's authority was on the ebb, a journey on the
knees around the labyrinth's sinuosities was prescribed
as an alternative to these pilgrimages. Perhaps this type
of penance was from the first imposed on those who,
through weakness or any other reason, were unable to
undertake long travels.</p>

<p>In the case of the wall labyrinths, of course, the journey
would be less arduous still, being performed by the
index finger.</p>

<p>Whether such practices ever obtained or not, most
writers who have had occasion to mention church labyrinths
during the past century have adopted, more or
less without question, the view that not only were the
labyrinths used in this way, but that they were in fact
designed for the purpose.</p>

<p>This view seems to rest chiefly on a statement by
J.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;F. Géruzez in his "Description of the City of
Rheims" (1817), to the effect that the labyrinth which
formerly lay in the cathedral was in origin an object of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
devotion, being the emblem of the interior of the Temple
of Jerusalem, but Géruzez quotes no authority for his
assertion. Another explanation, based upon the occurrence
of the figures of the architects or founders in certain
of the designs, is that the labyrinth was a sort of masonic
seal, signifying that the pious aim of the builder had been
to raise to the glory of God a structure to vie with the
splendours of the traditional Labyrinth. It is also said
that in some cases the "Chemins" were used for processional
purposes.</p>

<p>Some writers have held that the labyrinth was inserted
in the church as typifying the Christian's life or the
devious course of those who yield to temptation. Some
have thought that it represented the path from the house
of Pilate to Calvary, pointing out that Chateaubriand, in
his "Itinéraire de Paris à Jérusalem," mentioned two
hours as the period which he took to repeat Christ's journey,
and that the same time would be taken in traversing
the average pavement labyrinth on the knees.</p>

<p>The use of the labyrinth as a simile for the Christian's
life is shown in a stone inscription in the Museum at Lyons:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem intact">
<span class="i0">HOC SPECVLO · SPECVLARE LEGENS · QVOD SIS MORITVRVS:</span>
<span class="i0">QVOD CINIS IMMOLVTVM QVOD VERMIBVS ESCA FVTVRVS:</span>
<span class="i0">SED TAMEN VT SEMPER VIVAS · MALE VIVERE VITA:</span>
<span class="i0">XPM QVESO ROGA · SIT VT IN XPO MEA VITA:</span>
<span class="i0">ME CAPVT APRIL' · EX HOC RAPVIT LABERINTO:</span>
<span class="i0">PREBITVM · DOCEO VERSV MÃ FVNERA QÑTO:</span>
<span class="i6">STEPHANVS · FECIT OC.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Whether this inscription was ever attached to a labyrinthine
design is not known.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
It is strange if, amongst all the great mass of mediaeval
ecclesiastical literature, there is actually no indication of
the use or significance of these monuments in the service
of the Church; but no light appears to be forthcoming
from this source, and certainly the writings of the chief
authorities of these times give no support to any of the
theories mentioned above.</p>

<div id="ip_69" class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img id="Fig_58" src="images/i_122.jpg" width="500" height="397" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 58.</span>&mdash;Labyrinth in Church at Bourn, Cambs. (W.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;M.)</div></div>

<p>It is noteworthy that in none of the known examples
do any distinctively Christian emblems occur, and that,
amongst all the myriad inscriptions, paintings, and carvings
of the early Christians, in the catacombs of Rome
and elsewhere, the labyrinth never once figures.</p>

<p>So far as these islands are concerned the practice of
placing labyrinths in churches does not seem to have
become common.</p>

<p>In the "Architectural Dictionary" (1867) mention is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
made of one formerly existing in Canterbury Cathedral,
but no particulars are given.</p>

<p>On the floor below the tower of the church at Bourn,
Cambridgeshire, is a maze (<a href="#Fig_58">Fig.&nbsp;58</a>) worked in black
and red tiles, the centre being occupied by the font, the
step of which forms the terminus of the path. From the
fact that an intermediate portion of the path is concealed
beneath the base of the font it is plain that the position
of the latter is an after-thought, and from the design of
the maze, no less than from the character of the tiles of
which it is composed, the work would appear to be of
comparatively modern date. The modern specimen at
Ely has already been mentioned.</p>

<p>There is also a labyrinth, in this case engraved on the
floor of the church porch, at Alkborough, Lincolnshire,
but this is a modern replica of the turf maze in the
locality&mdash;a point which brings us to the subject of our
next chapter.</p>

<span class="subhead">TURF LABYRINTHS</span></h2>

<p>We have just remarked that the custom of placing labyrinth
designs in churches does not appear to have become
general on this side of the English Channel. We have in
England, however, a class of survivals peculiar to this
country which may be regarded as the equivalent of the
former. These are the <i>turf mazes</i> which are to be found
in various counties, usually under some local name, such
as "Mizmaze," "Julian's Bower," "Troy Town," or
"Shepherd's Race."</p>

<p>One of the best-preserved examples is that at Alkborough,
or Aukborough, a pretty village on the east
side of the Trent falls, where the Ouse and Trent join
to form the Humber. Crowning the hill is a square earthwork
called the Countess Close, supposed to be the remains
of a Roman Camp, and possibly the site of the
ancient Aquis. On the side of the hill is a basin-shaped
depression, in the turf of which is cut, to a depth of about
6 in., a labyrinth known as "Julian's Bower," or "Gilling
Bore," about 40 ft. in diameter. Our illustration
(<a href="#Fig_59">Fig.&nbsp;59</a>) is reproduced from a drawing kindly supplied
by the Rev. G. Yorke, Vicar of Alkborough. The configuration
of the maze is exactly the same as in a figure
published about a century ago in a little book called
"Terra Incognita of Lincolnshire," by Miss S. Hatfield.</p>

<p>In recent years it has been several times cleared out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
and trimmed up at the expense of Mr. J. Goulton Constable,
J.P., F.S.A., of Walcot Hall, who is lord of the
manor. Mr. Constable also caused the design of the maze
to be cut in the stone floor of the church porch, the
grooves being filled with cement, when the church was
restored in 1887.</p>

<div id="ip_72" class="figcenter" style="width: 487px;"><img id="Fig_59" src="images/i_125.jpg" width="487" height="500" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 59.</span>&mdash;"Julian's Bower," Alkborough, Lincs. (From a litho.
supplied by Rev. G. Yorke.)</div></div>

<p>In Saxon and Norman times, from about <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 1080 to
1220, there was a small monastic grange in the neighbourhood,
an offshoot of a Benedictine Monastery at
Spalding. Its site is now occupied by a farm-house
belonging to Magdalene College, Cambridge. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
proximity of the maze to an ancient ecclesiastical site is
not peculiar to this particular specimen, as we find a
similar juxtaposition in the case of many of the other
earth-mazes.</p>

<p>A correspondent, "J.&nbsp;F.," writing to <i>Notes and
Queries</i> about the Alkborough Julian's Bower in 1866,
says that he has lively impressions of the oft-repeated
pleasure derived from the feat of "running it in and out,"
in company with others, sixty years previously, and of
seeing the villagers playing May-eve games about it,
"under an indefinite persuasion of something unseen and
unknown co-operating with them." If this last-quoted
phrase is anything more than a whim of retrospective old
age it affords an interesting fragment of material for the
student of "folk-memory." There is a description of this
maze, under the name of Gillian's Bore, in the Diary,
written between 1671 and 1704, of Abraham de la
Pryme, "the Yorkshire Antiquary." He mentions at the
same time one situated at Appleby, about six miles away,
towards Brigg. This, he says, is called "Troy's Walls."
He describes them both as Roman games and says "they
are nothing but great labarinths cut upon the ground
with a hill cast up round them for the spectators to sit
round about on to behold the sport." The Appleby maze
was placed close to the Roman road that runs through
there, and has long since perished. No trace of it
remained when Allen's "History of Lincolnshire" was
published in 1834.</p>

<p>There is a turf labyrinth of a design similar to that at
Alkborough in a secluded romantic spot on land forming
part of the estate of the Hulse family, to the rear of their
beautiful country seat, Breamore House, Hants. It is
known as the Mizmaze, and consists of a grassy path 3 ft.
in width, the overall diameter being 87 ft. The "goal"
in the centre is 18 ft. in diameter, and forms a low mound.
Every curved portion of the path is slightly inclined towards
the centre of the maze, as if to afford a firmer footing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
to runners. When the writer visited it in July 1920 the
grooves were rather overgrown, but the maze receives
periodical attention from its owners, and is in no present
danger of becoming obliterated. It lies in that sparsely
populated corner of Hampshire which protrudes into
Wiltshire, between Salisbury and Cranborne Chase, and
is somewhat difficult to discover without directions, as it
is on a hilltop, and is surrounded by a thick copse, with
many other wooded hilltops in the neighbourhood. In
the few references that have been made to it by writers,
it has been variously described as being situated at Breamore,
at Rockbourne, Hants, and at Wickdown Hill,
Wilts. It is remote from the villages, but is best approached
from Breamore (pronounced <i>Bremmer</i> or <i>Brimmer</i>),
which is on the main road from Fordingbridge
to Salisbury. From this village to Breamore House is a
pleasant twenty-minutes' walk, and thence through the
beautifully wooded and gently rolling grounds of the
estate to the Mizmaze, a delightful half-hour's stroll. It
is advisable to seek precise directions before setting out,
because the path through the woods disappears after a
while in a meadow, and the copse in which the maze is
embedded appears at first impenetrable, having a narrow
opening on one side only, on the side remote from the
direction of approach. A local tradition says that a man
could run from the maze to Gallows Hill, more than half
a mile distant, and back again, while another ran round
the maze.</p>

<p>A charming little sketch of this maze, by Heywood
Sumner, accompanies a reference in Williams-Freeman's
"Field Archaeology in Hants."</p>

(Photo, W.&nbsp;J. Stocks. By permission of Rev. E.&nbsp;A. Irons)</div></div>

<p>Near Wing, in Rutland, a few miles to the north-east
of Uppingham, there is preserved a maze of very similar
design (<a href="#Fig_60">Fig.&nbsp;60</a>). It is maintained in good condition
and is still the object of periodical visits by the village
folk on certain holidays. Just to the south of it is a flat-topped
bowl-shaped tumulus, over 70 ft. in diameter and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
4 ft. high. It may be that the frequent association of turf
mazes with ancient earthworks of various kinds is something
more than accidental, but we do not seem to have
sufficient evidence to establish a necessary connection
between the two things.</p>

<p>Lyddington, another Rutland village, has also been
mentioned as possessing a turf maze. A writer in the
<i>Rutland Magazine</i> in 1907, for instance, says, in speaking
of Priestly Hill, which overlooks the village on the east,
"at one time there was a turf maze on its slope, where, as
our old people tell us, their grandparents, when children,
used to play." The writer in question, however, does not
make it clear whether he is really quoting an oral tradition
of the locality or is basing his statement on the
brief mention of Lyddington as a reputed maze-site
which appears in Trollope's 1858 memoir. It is at any
rate very difficult to trace any reliable evidence of such a
maze, and it seems not unlikely that Trollope's reference,
which is quite devoid of detail, may have had its origin
in a misinterpretation of the elaborate series of ancient
trenches situated in a field to the north-east of the church.
These trenches have been identified as the "fish-stews"
belonging to the old manor-house of the Bishops of
Lincoln.</p>

<p>The similarity between the designs of the turf mazes
mentioned above and those of some of the French pavement
labyrinths, that in Chartres Cathedral for example,
cannot fail to be noticed.</p>

<p>At Boughton Green, in Northamptonshire, about half
a mile from the village of Boughton and near the ruined
church of St. John the Baptist, was, until recently, a turf
maze of like design but having the innermost convolutions
of purely spiral form (<a href="#Fig_61">Fig.&nbsp;61</a>). It was 37 ft. in
diameter and was called the "Shepherd Ring" or "Shepherd's
Race." The "treading" of it was formerly a great
feature of the three days' fair in June, an event dating
from a charter by Edward III. in 1353.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
In a "Guide-book to Northampton" by G.&nbsp;N. Wetton,
published in 1849, the maze is spoken of as being in a
neglected condition. In a later book, however, a novel
named "The Washingtons," written by the Rev. J.&nbsp;N.
Simpkinson in 1860, occurs the following passage: "He
had just been treading the 'Shepherd's Labyrinth,' a
complicated spiral maze traced there upon the turf; and
was boasting of his skill, how dexterously and truly he
could pursue its windings without a single false step, and
how with a little more practice he would wager to go
through it blindfold."</p>

<div id="ip_76" class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img id="Fig_61" src="images/i_131.jpg" width="500" height="499" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 61.</span>&mdash;"Shepherd's Race," Boughton Green, Northants. (After
Trollope.)</div></div>

<p>Another novel, "The Last of the Climbing Boys," by
George Elson, contains a reference to it, in which it is
spoken of as being "An attraction which was the origin
of the fair"&mdash;a statement which it would be interesting
to verify if possible.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this famous relic was destroyed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
some of our soldiers in training during the Great War;
trenches were driven right across it, and practically all
traces of it are now obliterated.</p>

<p>There was formerly a specimen of somewhat similar
design on Ripon Common, Yorkshire, but this was
ploughed up in 1827. One of identical pattern at
Asenby, in the same county, was preserved until recent
times. According to Mr. A.&nbsp;H. Allcroft ("Earthwork of
England," 1908), it was sunk in a hollow at the top of
a hillock called "The Fairies' Hill," and is in a ruinous
condition, being quite unknown to most of the villagers,
although persons still living (in 1908) relate that they
have often trodden it on a summer's evening and knelt
at the centre "to hear the fairies singing."</p>

<p>The counties of Yorkshire and Lincolnshire seem to
have been particularly rich in records of these devices,
for in addition to those already mentioned we read of one
on the wold overlooking Louth, one at Horncastle, a
dozen miles to the south-west of Louth, one in Holderness,
between Marfleet and Paul, about four miles from
Hull, and another at Egton, near Whitby, where the
late Canon Greenwell in 1872 saw traces of it near
the main road to the north of the village. "July Park,"
or "St. Julian's," near Goathland, is also said to have
possessed a specimen, a fact which probably accounts
for the name of the place. The Horncastle maze is referred
to by Dr. Stukeley, a noted eighteenth-century
antiquary, as a "Julian's Bower" which is "much talked
of." He also mentions the Alkborough specimen and
others, coming to the conclusion that they were ancient
British relics, having been constructed as places of
exercise, or <i>cursus</i>, for the soldiery of those times. He
observes, somewhat contemptuously, that "lovers of antiquity,
especially of the inferior classes, always speak of
'em with great pleasure, as if there was something extraordinary
in the thing, though they cannot tell what."</p>

<p>The Louth "Gelyan Bower" is mentioned in a record<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
of 1544, "To nych mason for making at gelyan bower
a new crose, iijs." In an old hostelry in Mercer Row,
Louth, stood for some centuries a boulder of dolerite
called the "Blue Stone," which is stated to have formerly
occupied the centre of the maze. Trees planted at the
maze served as a landmark to ships out at sea.</p>

<p>The Horncastle example occupied a site to the south-west
of the town still known as the Julian Bower Close.
It has long been effaced by the agriculturist, and numerous
coins, fibulæ, and other Roman remains which have
been turned up on the spot have lent colour to the theory,
still maintained in the current county directory, that the
maze was a Roman work. The question whether this, or
any other turf maze in this country, is a relic of Roman
times we will discuss presently.</p>

<p>The maze near Hull was dodecagonal in outline, 40 ft.
across, and formed of grass paths 14 in. wide. Its plan
was much like that of the Alkborough maze, but the
paths were straight instead of curved. It was called "The
Walls of Troy." A coloured illustration of it was given
in Ackermann's "Repository of Arts" in 1815.</p>

<p>Although, as we have seen, Lincolnshire furnishes us
with records of more of these labyrinths than any other
county, there is no conclusive evidence that they were
in fact more numerous there than elsewhere. The reason
for our comparative wealth of information concerning
their existence in that part of the country may be due to
the fact that Dr. Edward Trollope, who first made a
serious study of these antiquities, and whose paper in the
<i>Archaeological Journal</i> for 1858 has been a fount of
inspiration to subsequent writers on the subject, was
Archdeacon of Stow, afterwards Bishop of Nottingham.</p>

<p>Turf labyrinths were formerly of general occurrence
throughout the country, for, in addition to those we have
already described, we find remains of them in counties
so widely separated as Kent and Cumberland. They are
also recorded as having existed in Wales and Scotland.</p>

<span class="subhead">TURF LABYRINTHS (<i>continued</i>)</span></h2>

<p>A mile or two outside Winchester and rising up above
the village of Chilcombe is the rounded shoulder of St.
Catherine's Hill, on the summit of which lies a curious
squarish "Mizmaze," the execution of which is often
ascribed by guide-books to a Winchester boy who, detained
at school during the vacation, beguiled his time
by the fashioning of this earthwork and by the composition
of the Wintonian "Dulce Domum." The interest of
this maze lies not so much in the fanciful ascription of its
origin as in the fact that it has apparently been cut, or re-cut,
by somebody who did not understand the meaning
of the plan given him to work upon. For, as will be seen
from our illustration (<a href="#Fig_62">Fig.&nbsp;62</a>), the actual labyrinth is
made, not by the turfed path, but by the narrow channel
by which it is delimited. In the few drawings of this maze
which the writer has been able to find the lines are all
straight, instead of being slightly curved as in our figure,
which was sketched on the spot, and it seemed possible
that they might represent an earlier condition of it, but
in each instance the labyrinth is formed by the groove,
which is hardly likely to have been the case in the original
design. The maze was re-cut by the Warden of Winchester,
who was guided by a plan in the possession of a
lady residing in the neighbourhood, about the middle of
last century, when it had become almost effaced. Possibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
the misinterpretation of the plan occurred on this
occasion. The maze is backed by a clump of pines,
planted by Lord Botetourt in 1770.</p>

<div id="ip_80" class="figcenter" style="width: 464px;"><img id="Fig_62" src="images/i_135.jpg" width="464" height="500" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 62.</span>&mdash;"Mizmaze," St. Catherine's Hill, Winchester. (W.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;M.)</div></div>

<p>There used to be, until a generation ago, a turf maze
at Leigh, in the north-west of Dorset. A writer in <i>Notes
and Queries</i> in 1868 describes it as being slightly
hollow, circular, thirty-three paces in diameter, and
enclosed by a bank three feet high. He adds: "I am sorry
to say the turf has grown over the little trenches and that
it is now impossible to trace the pattern of the maze."
Sir Frederick Treves, in his "Highways and Byways in
Dorset," 1906, speaks of this maze as having consisted
of "low banks and trenches arranged in an intricate
figure, which the youths of the village, accompanied no
doubt by the maidens, were wont to thread at certain
seasons of the year." He states that it is on high ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
in an open field and that of the winding passages no trace
now survives. Only the low bank and ditch surrounding
the maze remain visible.</p>

<div id="ip_81" class="figcenter" style="width: 471px;"><img id="Fig_63" src="images/i_136.jpg" width="471" height="500" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 63.</span>&mdash;"Troy-town," Pimperne, Dorset. (Hutchins.)</div></div>

<p>At Pimperne, not far from Blandford, there was formerly
a maze of a unique design (<a href="#Fig_63">Fig.&nbsp;63</a>). John Aubrey,
writing in 1686, says it was "much used by the young
people on Holydaies and by ye School-boies." The path
was bounded by ridges about a foot in height. The maze
was destroyed by the plough in 1730. The memory of
another turf maze in the same country is preserved in
the name of Troy-town, applied to a locality about three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
miles north-east of Dorchester. One is also said to have
existed near Bere Regis. Aubrey goes on to refer to
another at West Ashton, near Trowbridge, Wiltshire,
and one "on the Cotteswold Downes, where Mr. Dover's
Games were celebrated." He mentions them also in his
"Natural History and Antiquities of Surrey," and concludes
his reference by quoting what he calls a "Poetical
Description" of them, by Thomas Randolph, a poet and
dramatist of the seventeenth century, the so-called
description being nothing more than an indictment of
the lazy shepherd swain, who prefers to spend his leisure
in sleeping under a bush when, according to the poet, he
ought</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"... to tune his Reed and chant his layes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or nimbly run the windings of the Maze."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">This is from Thomas Randolph's (or Randall's)
"Eglogue on the Palilia and Noble Assemblies revived
on Cotswold Hills by Mr. Robert Dover," one of a collection
of eulogies&mdash;the <i>Annalia Dubrensia</i>&mdash;by various
poets of the day of the then famous annual sports
organised by Captain Dover on the hills near Chipping
Campden. Mazes, or "laborinths," are referred to in the
contributions of several of the other poets concerned, of
whom we may mention Francis Izod, Nicholas Wallington,
William Bellas and William Denny. A figure in the
crude frontispiece conveys a similar allusion.</p>

<p>In Essex we have an example of rather larger dimensions
than the majority, namely, that on the east side of
the common at Saffron Walden (<a href="#Fig_64">Fig.&nbsp;64</a>). A tall bank
hides it from the Thaxted road, which runs within a few
yards of it. The four bastions (or "bellows") and the
centre are slightly raised. The overall dimensions are
approximately 91 ft., excluding the bastions, and 138 ft.
from corner to corner.</p>

<p>This maze is referred to in the Corporation account
books for the year 1699, when it was apparently re-cut.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
On several subsequent occasions it became neglected
and almost obliterated, but fortunately there has always
been some person sufficiently interested to cause its
renovation. According to a local record, re-cuttings have
taken place in 1828, 1841, 1859, 1887, and 1911. On
the last occasion it was underlaid with bricks, to facilitate
future renovations.</p>

<div id="ip_83" class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img id="Fig_64" src="images/i_138.jpg" width="500" height="497" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 64.</span>&mdash;Turf Labyrinth, Saffron Walden, Essex. (W.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;M.)</div></div>

<p>As in the case of the Winchester example, the "path"
consists of the narrow and shallow groove instead of the
raised turf, and this gives some weight to the tradition
that it is only a copy of a much larger maze which
formerly existed further to the east.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
In a manuscript book of the latter part of the
eighteenth century the maze is spoken of as a favourite
resort for the young bloods of the town, a complicated
system of rules and wagers (in gallons of beer) being laid
down in connection with walking the maze.</p>

<p>It is stated that a large ash tree at one time occupied
the centre, but that it perished by fire in the Guy Fawkes
celebrations of November 5, 1823.</p>

<p>A few years ago some boys, playing on the central
mound, discovered a Roman coin. This does not, of
course, prove that the work is of Roman origin.</p>

<p>In the 1789 edition of Camden's "Britannia" a
drawing of the maze exhibits merely a series of concentric
circles with extensions on the outermost pair forming
the "bastions." This illustration could hardly have
been prepared on the spot.</p>

<p>About twenty miles to the north-west of Saffron
Walden and a few miles to the west of Cambridge lies
the little village of Comberton (Cambs). The playground
of the village school occupies one corner at the
cross-roads, and in the south-west angle of this, enclosed
by iron railings, lies a turf maze of a pattern similar to
that at Alkborough. Owing to the use which the school
children make of it the paths are nearly denuded of
grass, but the ridges are well defined, as shown by the
photograph (<a href="#Fig_65">Fig.&nbsp;65</a>), which was taken in March 1921.
The present maze is a faithful copy of that which was
formerly situated a few yards away, and which, when the
school was built, occupied an inconvenient position just
outside the scholars' entrance. The old maze was known
as the "Mazles." It used to be the custom in the village
to have a feast once every three years, and at such times
the maze was re-cut.</p>

<p>Comberton, by the way, is almost the next village to
Bourn, where, as we have seen, a peculiar pavement
maze occupies the floor of the church tower.</p>

<p>Fig. 67. Turf Labyrinth, Hilton, Hunts.</p></div></div>

<p>In the neighbouring county of Huntingdon we find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
a splendidly preserved maze, of curious plan, in a corner
of the green in the rambling and out-of-the-way but
charming village of Hilton (<a href="#Fig_66">Fig.&nbsp;66</a>).</p>

<div id="ip_85" class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img id="Fig_66" src="images/i_142.jpg" width="500" height="498" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 66.</span>&mdash;Turf Labyrinth, Hilton, Hunts. (W.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;M.)</div></div>

<p>These turf labyrinths are in most cases liable to
escape the notice of all but the intentional seeker, owing
to their flat and grassy nature, and the difficulty is accentuated
in the case of Hilton by reason of the fact that the
maze is at some little distance from the road, and is,
moreover, sunk to a depth of several inches below the
general level of the surrounding turf. It may easily be
located, however, if one remembers that the centre is
marked by a square stone obelisk surmounted by a ball.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
This obelisk has indications of a sun-dial on the north
face, with the words "A.B. hoc." On its south face it
bears a coat of arms, engraved within a circle, and the
inscription: "Sic transit gloria mundi. Gulielmus
Sparrow, Gen., natus ano. 1641. Aetatis sui 88 quando
obiit, hos gyros formavit anno 1660." On the east face
is engraved, "William Sparrow departed this life the
25th August, Anno Domini 1729, aged 88 years." The
west face bears only the words "Dep. hoc." Our photograph
(<a href="#Fig_67">Fig.&nbsp;67</a>) shows the obelisk and as much of the
maze as could conveniently be included with the camera
used. It will be noticed that the trenches between the
paths are fairly wide and deeply cut.</p>

<p>The good state of preservation is no doubt greatly
due to the fact, remarked by a writer of half a century
ago, that the paths are made up with pebbles. No sign of
the latter is now evident amongst the thick turf. The
plan of the maze shows some interesting variations on
the older and more conventional designs of Alkborough,
Comberton, etc., the most remarkable point being that
the path from the exterior to the centre is almost direct,
the labyrinth proper being composed of paths which
commence and terminate at the central plot. The Hilton
maze appears to be unique in this respect.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been the original purpose of
turf labyrinths in this country as a whole, it is fairly clear
that the Hilton example at any rate was not made for
ecclesiastical purposes if, as stated on the obelisk, it was
constructed in 1660. On the other hand, the reflection
that at that date Puritan influences were on the decline
and the restoration of the Monarchy was imminent leads
one to conclude that this somewhat exuberant design of
a youth of nineteen was intended for purposes of rustic
enjoyment.</p>

Ferguson.)</div></div>

<p><a href="#Fig_68">Fig.&nbsp;68</a> shows a labyrinth formerly incised in the
turf of the marshes of Rockcliffe in Cumberland, near
the shores of the Solway Firth. It covered a space of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
26 ft. by 24 ft. and had a 9-in. path bounded by an
8-in. groove. It went by the name of "The Walls of
Troy." The two villages of Burgh and Rockcliffe are
distant from one another about two miles and a half, and
the river Eden bisects the intervening marshes and
occasionally floods them. A certain point on the marsh
is known as "Willie of the Boats," from the fact that
prior to 1816, when the main road from Carlisle to Glasgow
passed this way, a man of that name lived here and
acted as guide through the marshes and over the river
fords. A maze existed close to this spot and is said to
have been cut in 1815 by a man named Christopher
Graham. Whether Graham designed the maze himself or
whether he copied an already existing specimen cannot
now be determined, but it is stated that a smaller and
probably older maze existed side by side with his. Both
have now entirely disappeared. The maze figured, however,
was about a mile from this spot and was still in
existence in 1883, though much overgrown. The local
tradition declared it to have been cut by Robert Edgar,
a sailor, who was subsequently drowned at sea. All three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
of the mazes mentioned were apparently of similar
design. A friend of the writer was unable to find any
traces of a maze in the locality in 1920.</p>

<p>On the summit of a hill by St. Anne's Well, Sneinton,
Nottingham, there formerly existed a maze called
"Robin Hood's Race," or "Shepherd's Race." It was of
a design somewhat similar to that at Saffron Walden, but
having each of the four bastions ornamented with an incised
figure of the type known in heraldry as a "Cross,
crosslet, fitchy." The path was stated to be 535 yards in
total length. When the lordship of Sneinton was enclosed,
in February 1797, the maze was ploughed up.
An enterprising printer of Nottingham, J. Wigsby by
name, preserved for us the plan by publishing in the
following month an illustrated pamphlet in commemoration
of the maze, "Sixpence plain, eightpence coloured."</p>

<p>Another turf maze used to exist in the same neighbourhood,
namely, at Clifton, about four miles or so from
Sneinton, on the opposite side of Nottingham. This was
of a square design similar to that of the garden maze
shown in <a href="#Fig_75">Fig.&nbsp;75</a>.</p>

<p>At Somerton, near Banbury, Oxfordshire, there has
been well preserved a very good "Troy-town" (<a href="#Fig_69">Fig.&nbsp;69</a>), of
a plan which recalls that on the tiles of Toussaints Abbey.
It is situated in the garden of a farm-house, named after it
"Troy," and is surrounded by beautiful trees and shrubs.
Our drawing is made from a sketch kindly supplied by the
brother of the present occupier, Mr. J.&nbsp;F. Godwin. Its
dimensions are 57 ft. by 50 ft., and the turf path, one foot
in width, has a total length of 400 yards.</p>

<div id="ip_88" class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img id="Fig_69" src="images/i_146.jpg" width="500" height="459" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 69.</span>&mdash;"Troy-town," Somerton, Oxon. (From sketch by
O.&nbsp;W. Godwin.)</div></div>

<p>Near Piddington, on the border of the same county,
rises to a height of nearly 400 ft. above the village the
eminence known as Muswell Hill. Close to the summit of
the hill is an earthwork having the form of a square turfed
level surrounded by a low bank and bearing the traditional
name of "The Wilderness." It is often spoken of locally
as a Roman camp, but there is nothing in its structure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
to suggest such an origin: no satisfactory explanation of
its origin or purpose has, in fact, been hitherto forthcoming.
Now the word "wilderness," as we shall see in
a subsequent chapter, was employed during a certain
period to denote a maze of the horticultural type, and it
is not improbable that it was used in connection with
mazes in general. May we not, therefore, allow it to
be within the realms of legitimate surmise that this
mysterious work constitutes the remains of a square turf
maze, perhaps of a design similar to that of the Clifton
maze mentioned above? The situation, the enclosing bank,
and the regular outline of the latter accord well with this
supposition, though the dimensions&mdash;250 ft. square&mdash;are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
rather excessive unless we allow for a considerable margin
between the bank and the maze itself.</p>

<p>Another Oxfordshire locality, Tadmarton Heath, is
mentioned as a turf maze site in a manuscript by the
Rev. T. Leman, quoted in a county history published in
1861, but if such a work ever existed there all traces of it
have now disappeared; the same is true with regard to
another reputed maze site to which reference is made
in the manuscript, namely, the Herefordshire Beacon, in
the Malvern Hills. In both cases the situations are such
as might well have been selected for the purpose, judging
by analogy with other known turf maze sites. Sixty
years is none too long a period to allow of the complete
obliteration of the turf figures, if such existed, in the
absence of care and attention, so that it is not surprising
if we now find ourselves unable to trace them, especially
if they possessed no circumscribing bank or ditch.</p>

<p>In Surrey a "Troy-town" was formerly well known
in the neighbourhood of Guildford. It was cut in the turf
on Hillbury, between Guildford and Farnham. It may
be that the earth-rings of which traces are yet visible on
St. Martha's Hill, on the other side of Guildford, constitute
the remains of a similar work. It is said that the
youths and maidens of the town used to congregate here
on Good Friday and indulge in boisterous celebrations,
the origin of which is not known. Another Surrey spot
formerly alluded to as having a turf maze is Putney
Heath. Unfortunately, however, we cannot at present
point to any authentic traces of a single specimen in the
whole of the county.</p>

<p>At Chilham, near Godmersham, in Kent, is an earthwork
on the downs known as Julaber's Barrow or Juliberry's
Grave. It bears no traces of mazy paths, but the
name carries strong suggestion of "Julian's Bower," and
there is perhaps as much force in this suggestion as in
the opposing view that the mound is the grave of Quintus
Laberius Durus, one of Julius Caesar's tribunes (hence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
<i>Julii Laberius</i>), who was killed by the Britons. The latter
theory was, however, maintained by a writer to <i>The Times</i>
as recently as April 5, 1920. The fact that as late as 1893,
according to a letter to <i>Notes and Queries</i> of that year,
traces of a "bower" or "Troy-town" were still observable
in the neighbourhood of Walmer, shows that the Chilham
work, if a turf maze, would not have been unique
in the county. It is also said that one formerly existed
near Westerham; the name "Troy-town," moreover,
survives in other parts of the county (see p. <a href="#Page_211">211</a>).
Additional support for the theory of a turf maze site
at Chilham is found in the occurrence of the name
Bowerland, applied to a district to the north of the
village. We find, too, a hamlet of Bower, only a few
miles to the south-west.</p>

<p>In Bedfordshire, not far from Dunstable, there is a
circular earthwork on the downs called "Maiden Bower."
Stukeley refers to it in his discussion on Julian's Bowers
as being in his opinion the site of a former turf maze, and
there is some force in this contention. He mentions in
the same reference a similar work at Ashwell.</p>

<p>Dr. Trollope stated that specimens had been reported
also from the county of Devonshire and in Scotland,
but actual details are not at the moment available.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the custom of cutting these
devices in the turf was formerly very widespread throughout
the land, although comparatively few examples now
exist. Even during the past generation, as we have seen,
some are known to have disappeared. Let us therefore
hope that all possible care will be taken to preserve those
that remain to us.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE ORIGIN OF TURF MAZES</span></h2>

<p>In 1858&mdash;the year in which Archdeacon Trollope
published the results of his researches&mdash;Capt. W.&nbsp;H.
Mounsey drew attention to the description in a Welsh
history book ("Drych y Prif Oesoedd," published in
1740) of a curious custom formerly prevalent among
the Welsh shepherds. This custom consisted of cutting
in the turf a figure in the form of a labyrinth, which they
called Caerdroia, <i>i.e.</i> the walls, or citadel, of Troy. He
also remarked that the herdsmen of Burgh and Rockcliffe
"at the present day are in the habit of cutting this labyrinthine
figure, which they also call 'the Walls of Troy.'"
He drew the tentative conclusion that this name "would
seem to be an after-thought of pure Cymric origin, suggested
by the similarity between <i>Caerdroia</i>, the City of
Troy, and <i>Caer y troiau</i>, the city of windings or turnings."
A similar suggestion had already been made in the
<i>Transactions of the Cymmrodorion Society</i> in 1822, the
writer ("Idrison") holding that the turf figures, and also
those on the Knossian coins, had reference to the courses
of the sun as conceived by ancient worshippers of that orb.</p>

<p>Captain Mounsey was promptly answered by Dr.
Trollope, who referred to the wide distribution of these
devices throughout England and commented on their
total absence from Brittany, where, if they were of ancient
Cymric origin, one would have expected to find at least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
some trace of them. He also stated that they first received
the name of "Troy-towns" in Tudor days, when "subtleties"
of all kinds were in vogue, the term being used
simply to indicate, by analogy with the Troy of legend,
the difficulties to be overcome before the centre could
be reached. Dr. Trollope gave it as his considered
opinion that they were originally cut for penitential purposes
by ecclesiastics, and this opinion has since his time
remained practically unchallenged. In his memoir on the
subject he reproduces a sketch showing the St. Anne's
Hill maze with two gowned and kneeling persons in the
act of performing a penitential circuit. Both the sketch
and Dr. Trollope's conclusion are based on inference,
however; there does not appear to be any direct evidence
in the matter.</p>

<p>The theory of an ecclesiastical origin of the turf mazes
is chiefly supported by analogy with the continental
church labyrinths which many of them so strongly
resemble. Against the argument of their frequent proximity
to an ecclesiastical site we may place that of their
equally frequent proximity to known Roman remains
and the fact that many of our old churches were founded
on Roman sites.</p>

<p>The Welsh custom above referred to was also described
by P. Roberts in his "Cambrian Popular Antiquities,"
published in 1815. He gives a plan of the figure
as usually cut&mdash;a design resembling the circular labyrinths
on Knossian coins, but flattened on the side where
the entrance is situated&mdash;and expresses dissatisfaction
with it because there are "no means of losing the way
into the citadel, the supposed way continuing regularly
through all its windings unbroken, which could scarcely
have been the design of the inventor" (<a href="#Fig_70">Fig.&nbsp;70</a>).</p>

<p>This figure, he says, is the plan of a labyrinth which
is sometimes cut out in the turf by shepherd boys whilst
they are tending their flocks on the mountains of Wales,
and is sometimes drawn and presented as a puzzle by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
boys to exercise the ingenuity of their school-fellows,
either in finding their way to the citadel at the centre or
in drawing the plan. The tradition which accompanies
the plan is that the city of Troy was defended by seven
walls represented by the seven exterior lines and the
entrance made as intricate as possible in order to frustrate
an attacking force.</p>

<div id="ip_94" class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img id="Fig_70" src="images/i_151.jpg" width="500" height="437" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 70.</span>&mdash;"Caerdroia." (After P.
Roberts.)</div></div>

<p>On the question whether turf mazes were, as Dr.
Trollope affirmed, constructed by ecclesiastics for
penitential purposes, there does not appear to be
sufficient evidence to
form a final decision.
Even if it be true that
they, and the pavement
labyrinths, were actually
used in the manner
mentioned&mdash;a statement
for which we do
not seem to have definite
proof&mdash;it by no
means follows that they
were designed with that
object. We do know for
certain that they were,
from Tudor times onwards, used for recreational purposes.
In his "Midsummer Night's Dream" (Act II., Sc. i.)
Shakespeare makes Titania say, in her reply to Oberon
(after the latter had twitted her with her love for Theseus):</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"... the quaint mazes in the wanton green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For lack of tread are undistinguishable."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>In "The Tempest" also (Act III., Sc. iii.) he makes the
old counsellor Gonzalo say:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"By'r lakin, I can go no further, sir,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My old bones ache: here's a maze trod indeed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through forth-rights and meanders: by your patience<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I needs must rest me";<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>
<p class="in0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
and further on (Act V., Sc. i.) he puts a similar phrase
into the mouth of Alonso:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"This is as strange a maze as e'er man trod:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there is in this business more than nature<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was ever conduct of."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>It is most likely that the turf mazes were in existence
long before Shakespeare's time. The similarity of design
between some of them and certain of the continental
church labyrinths, which has already been alluded to,
furnishes some grounds for supposing that they were
contemporary with the latter in origin, in which case
they would most probably have been constructed in the
twelfth or thirteenth centuries. The fact that several of
them were situated in the neighbourhood of some religious
institution also lends support to the assertion
that they were of monastic workmanship. There is no
reason, however, to suppose that their construction and
the handing on of the labyrinth tradition was confined
to ecclesiastics.</p>

<p>According to M. Berthelot, who made a special study
of the work of the ancient and mediaeval alchemists, a
similar figure was employed by the latter. At any rate he
found in an eleventh-century alchemistic manuscript,
which he refers to as the Manuscript of St. Mark, Venice,
a labyrinth drawing closely resembling the ecclesiastical
type, accompanied by a commentary in Greek verse. He,
however, expresses the opinion that both the labyrinth
and the verses are an addition of the fourteenth or
fifteenth century. The figure, he says, is referred to as
"The Labyrinth of Solomon."</p>

<p>The name of Solomon was in use at least as late as
1844 in connection with labyrinthine figures. In that
year M. Didron, a noted French archaeologist, whilst
making a tour through Greece, visited the convent of
St. Barlaam, a building perched high up on a huge crag
and approached only by a rope. On the wall of the guestroom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
he observed a red tracing of a labyrinth resembling
that on the floor of Chartres Cathedral. M. Didron inquired
as to the origin of it, and was informed that it was
called the "Prison de Salomon" and that it had been
copied on the wall long before by a monk who had found
the design in a book. The monk was dead and the book
lost. This "Solomon's Prison" was of the same character
as the "Solomon's Labyrinth" described by M. Berthelot,
but very probably these and similar terms were at one
time as popular as "Chemin de Jérusalem," "Julian's
Bower," and so on, in their application to all sorts of
labyrinthine devices.</p>

<p>A simple "interrupted-circle" type of labyrinth was
adopted as a heraldic device by Gonzalo Perez, a Spanish
ecclesiastic who acted as Secretary to Charles V and
Philip II, and published in 1566 a translation of Homer's
"Odyssey." The labyrinth was shown in perspective,
with the Minotaur, in fighting attitude, at the centre. It
was surmounted by the motto <i>In silentio et spe</i>.</p>

<p>No doubt continental heraldry could furnish us with
many similar references of the sort, although nothing of
the kind seems to occur in English heraldry. In <a href="#Fig_71">Fig.&nbsp;71</a>,
for instance, is shown one used by Bois-dofin de Laval,
Archbishop of Embrun. The motto in this case was
<i>Fata viam invenient</i> ("The Fates will find a way"), a
motto adopted in England by the Berkshire Vansittarts.
Our illustration is copied from an early seventeenth-century
book entitled "Devises Héroïques et Emblèmes,"
by Claude Paradin.</p>

<p>In the text it is stated that "par ce labyrinthe ...
se pourroit entendre que pour rencontrer la voye, &amp;
chemin de vie eternelle, la grace de Dieu nous adresse:
nous mettant entre les mains le filet de ses saincts commandemens.
A ce que le tenans &amp; suivans tousiours nous
venions a nous tirer hors des dangereux foruoyemens des
destroits mõdains." In other words, the device may be
taken as emblematical of the temptation-labyrinth of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
worldly life, which can only be safely traversed by means
of the Ariadne thread of divine grace.</p>

<p>The design in this case is of a peculiar type, but it
may be very easily derived from the simple split-ring or
"Pigs in Clover" design (<a href="#Fig_144">Fig.&nbsp;144</a>).</p>

<div id="ip_97" class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img id="Fig_71" src="images/i_154.jpg" width="500" height="498" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 71.</span>&mdash;Labyrinth Device of Archbishop of Embrun. (After
C. Paradin.)</div></div>

<p>We have in the two cases just mentioned, as in the
case of the pavement labyrinths, an association with the
Church or with ecclesiastics. At the same time we know
that, in England at any rate, the turf mazes were used
for sportive purposes in the days of Elizabeth, and there
is, so far, a lack of contemporary reference to their employment
in a devotional or penitential capacity. "Treading"
or "threading" the maze was a favourite game for
several generations. Seeing that the path in the turf
maze has as a rule no branches or dead-ends, the sport in
question would appear to have been rather simple in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
character, unless we imagine the participants to have
been blindfolded for the purpose or primed with a
tankard or two of some jocund beverage.</p>

<p>Let us refer once more to that chapter of Pliny's
"Natural History" in which he says that we must not
compare the Egyptian and other labyrinths with "what
we see traced on our mosaic pavements <i>or to the mazes
formed in the fields for the entertainment of children</i>." The
italicised words clearly show that the construction of
something akin to our turf mazes was practised by the
Romans. It seems very reasonable to infer that, if the
custom were so common as Pliny seems to imply, it would
have been carried to the Roman colonies in these islands.
An argument which has often been brought forward in
this connection is that from very early times the game of
Troy, the <i>lusus Trojae</i>, was played by Roman youths.
Virgil describes it in the fifth book of his "Aeneid," and
draws attention to the similarity between the mazy windings
of this sport&mdash;which was performed on horseback&mdash;and
the sinuous path of the Cretan labyrinth (see Chapter
XVIII). The inference drawn from this is that our
"Troy-towns" and the sports connected with them are
in the direct line of descent from this classic game and
are therefore a legacy of the Roman occupation of
Britain.</p>

<p>Dr. Stukeley, whom we had occasion to mention with
reference to the Horncastle maze, suggested that the
term Julian's Bower was derived from the name of Iulus,
the son of Aeneas, who is described as having taken part
in the game. We see, then, that there is a good deal to be
said for the claim of a Roman origin.</p>

<p>Assuming for the moment that such was the case, we
are faced with some difficulty in accounting for the preservation
throughout the intervening ages of a class of
earthwork which, without attention, is liable to become
effaced in a few decades.</p>

<p>Is it likely that the Britons, after the Roman recall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
would trouble to preserve the playgrounds of their late
rulers' children? Is it at all probable that the successive
waves of immigrants, Anglo-Saxons, Danes and Norsemen,
would concern themselves with the maintenance of
such alien frivolities?</p>

<p>Is there not a chance that perhaps some of these invaders
brought the custom with them?</p>

<p>If we had to rely solely on our own historical records,
we should find it extremely difficult to arrive at any conclusion
in the matter. Researches of recent decades have,
however, rendered it possible to approach the matter
from a much wider angle, and, before we attempt any
further to inquire into the origin of our own turf mazes,
we shall find it necessary to go back very far indeed in
the history of European civilisation, and to look at the
question of labyrinth origins from another point of view.</p>

<p>Before doing so, however, we will review a development
which, in the eyes of the archaeologist an insignificant
side-line, is perhaps to many readers a matter of
greater interest than anything we have yet dealt with,
embracing as it does that type of labyrinth which is
familiar to all in the famous Hampton Court specimen.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE FLORAL LABYRINTH AND THE DWARF-SHRUB
MAZE</span></h2>

<p>The mention of the word "maze" most frequently calls
to mind a block of tall shrubs penetrated by a puzzling
branching path, which terminates in an arbour or goal
of some sort. But just as we have seen that the horticultural
maze is far from being the sole form of expression
of the idea, so we must now recognise that even in horticulture
the well-known hedge maze is not the only type
of verdant labyrinth.</p>

<p>The dwarf box, although a favourite material for delimiting
flower beds and edging paths, is merely a subordinate
or "accompanying" instrument, so to speak, in
the gardener's orchestra. Yet we do occasionally see it
employed as a soloist, executing its modest little arabesques
between the strepitant choruses of the chromatic
parterres on the terrace of some stately country home.
In such cases we see a relic of the "knots" which formed
an important feature in the gardens of our forefathers.</p>

<div id="ip_100" class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img id="Fig_72" src="images/i_158.jpg" width="500" height="373" alt="" /><div class="caption">Fig. 72. Floral Labyrinth (De Vries).</div></div>

<div id="ip_100b" class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img id="Fig_74" src="images/i_161.jpg" width="500" height="371" alt="" /><div class="caption">Fig. 74. Floral Labyrinth (De Vries).</div></div>

<p>These devices were composed of various herbs or low
shrubs and great ingenuity was displayed in their fashioning,
amongst other forms being several varieties of labyrinths.
The praises of the dwarf box in this connection
were sung by John Parkinson, herbalist to Queen Elizabeth
and King James the First. In his "Paradisus" he
mentions it thus: "... Boxe, which lastly I chiefly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
above all other herbs commend unto you, and being a
small, low, or dwarfe kind, is called French or Dutch
Boxe." This plant, he says, "serveth very well to set out
any knot or border out any beds, for besides that it is
ever greene, it being reasonable thicke set, will easily be
cut and formed into any fashion one will, according to
the nature thereof, which is to grow very slowly, and will
not in a long time rise to be of any height, but shooting
forth many small branches from the roote, will grow very
thicke and yet not require so great tending, nor so much
perish as any of the former ...," and so on, in typical
labyrinthine prose. The use of dwarf box in this way was
not, of course, a novelty in Parkinson's time. In fact it
was used by the Romans to border their paths and the
flower-beds of that little garden in front of the porticoes
which went by the name of the <i>xystus</i>.</p>

<p>In the sixteenth century, however, the planting of
dwarf shrubs and herbs in long narrow beds twisted into
various complicated figures seems to have become very
fashionable.</p>

<p>Where maze patterns were introduced, a simple, unicursal
form was sometimes followed, but in many instances
very elaborate mazes were executed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span></p>

<div id="ip_101" class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img id="Fig_73" src="images/i_163.jpg" width="500" height="357" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 73.</span>&mdash;Floral Labyrinth. (De Vries.)</div></div>

<p>In a few of our libraries are to be found copies of a
curious book of garden designs by Jan Vredeman De
Vries, entitled "Hortorum Viridariorumque Formae,"
published at Antwerp in 1583. In it are represented many
extraordinary and even fantastic plans for the lay-out of
gardens, including no less than nine in the form of labyrinths.
Some of the latter are designated by titles of a
descriptive or of a quasi-classic character, "La Roue,"
"Ionica," "Corinthia," and so forth. We reproduce a few
of these designs in <a href="#Fig_72">Figs.&nbsp;72</a>, <a href="#Fig_73">73</a> and <a href="#Fig_74">74</a>. Several other
horticultural or architectural books of about the same
period also mention labyrinths or figure them in their
illustrations, but it is not clear, in many cases, whether
these are intended to represent garden mazes or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
flower-bed labyrinths that we have just mentioned. In
some instances, where the beds were occupied by shrubs,
we have a sort of link between the garden labyrinth and
the hedge maze proper. An illustration in a book of 1573
on the gardens of the Villa d'Este at Tivoli, dedicated
to Catherine de Medici by the author, Stefano Duperac,
shows four rectangular labyrinths, all of the same pattern.
It is unlikely that in such circumstances they would all
have been formed of tall hedges, and we may therefore
judge them to have been of the flower-bed type or perhaps
of dwarf box.</p>

<p>We find a reference to the herbal labyrinth in "La
Maison Rustique," by Charles Estienne (Paris, 1573),
under the heading of "Kitchen Garden Planning":</p>

<p>"Et sera bon dresser a ceste fin une planche de sauge
... encore une de sariette, &amp; hyssope, de cost, de
basilic, aspic, baume, pouliot &amp; une de camomille pour
faire les siéges &amp; labyrinthes, que l'on nomme Daedalus."</p>

<p>One of the best-known and most often quoted of the
Tudor gardening books is that of Thomas Hyll, or Hill,
whose work "A moste Briefe and Pleasaunt Treatyse
Teachynge How to Dress, Sowe and Set a Garden" was
published in 1563. It has a captivating charm, especially
in the earlier, black-letter editions. In later editions the
name of the author appears as "Didymus Mountaine"
(Didymus = Thomas, Mountaine = Hill), and the
book becomes "The Gardener's Labyrinth."</p>

<p>He published two figures of mazes, which we reproduce
as <a href="#Fig_75">Figs.&nbsp;75</a> and <a href="#Fig_76">76</a>. In the 1579 edition&mdash;"The
Profitable Art of Gardening"&mdash;they are respectively
placed at the heads of different chapters, the openings of
which are worth quoting:</p>

<div id="ip_103" class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img id="Fig_75" src="images/i_165.jpg" width="500" height="412" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 75.</span>&mdash;Herbal Labyrinth. (T. Hill, 1579.)</div></div>

<p>"Here by the way (Gentle Reader) I do place two
proper Mazes, the one before this Chapter, and the other
after, as proper adornments upon pleasure to a Garden,
that who so listeth, having such roomth in their Garden,
may place the one of them, which liketh them best, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
that voide place of the Garden that maye beste be spared
for the onelye purpose, to sporte in them at times, which
mazes being workmanly handled by the Gardner shal
much beautifie them in devising four sundry fruits to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
placed in each of the corners of the Maze and in the
middle of it a proper Herber decked with Roses, or else
some faire tree of Rosemary, or other fruits, at the discretion
of the Gardener."</p>

<p>"And here, I also place the other Maze, which may
be lyke ordered and used, as I spake before, and it may
eyther be set with Isope and Time, or with winter Savery
and Tyme; for these do wel endure all ye winter through
greene. And there be some which set their mazes with
Lavender, Cotton Spike, Majerome and such like. But
let them be ordered in this point, as liketh best the Gardener,
and so an end. For I doe not here set forth this,
or the other Maze afore expressed, for any necessarie
commoditie in a Garden, but rather appoint eyther of
them (which liketh you best) as a beautifying unto your
Garden: for that Mazes and Knots aptly made do much
set forth a garden which neverthelesse I referre to your
discretion for that not all persons be of like abilitie."</p>

<p>One would have expected to find some word concerning
mazes in Lord Bacon's Essay on Gardening, but,
strange to say, he makes no reference whatever to mazes
or labyrinths. He abhorred topiary work. "I, for my
part," he says, "do not like images cut out in juniper or
other garden stuff&mdash;they be for children." Mazes he
apparently considered unworthy even of mention.</p>

<p>Hill's square maze reappears, but with a tree at the
centre, in another gardening book which achieved much
popularity in the seventeenth century, namely, "A New
Orchard and Garden," by William Lawson (1623), afterwards
published (1638, 1648, etc.), bound up with "A
Way to get Wealth," by Gervase Markham. This is a
quaint little publication which embodies amongst other
things a "Table of Hard Words." "Mazes well framed
a man's height," says Lawson (ch. xvii.), "may perhaps
make your friend wander in gathering of berries, till he
cannot recover himself without your help." In the division
entitled "The Country Hous-Wife's Garden" we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
are told that "The number of Formes, Mazes and Knots
is so great, and Men are so diversly delighted that I
leave every House-wife to her selfe, expecially seeing to
set downe many, had been but to fill much Paper; yet lest
I deprive her of all delight and direction, let her view
these few, choice, new Forms, and note these generally,
that all Plots are square, and all are bordered about with
Privit, Rasins, Fea-berries, Roses, Thorne, Rosemary,
Bee-flowers, Isop, Sage or such like."</p>

<div id="ip_106" class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img id="Fig_77" src="images/i_167.jpg" width="500" height="248" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs. 77, 78.</span>&mdash;Maze Designs in Seventeenth Century Manuscript.<br />
(Harley MS.)</div></div>

<p>Let us hope that the Hous-Wife whose duty was to
prepare and keep in order these "Choice new Forms"
had plenty of time on her hands.</p>

<p>The two mazes included in a tiny book amongst the
Harley Manuscripts (<a href="#Fig_77">Figs.&nbsp;77 and 78</a>) were probably
intended for flower-bed mazes. The book consists of a collection
of 166 sketches of flower-beds, "knots," etc., and
probably belonged to some seventeenth-century gardener.</p>

<p>These mazes, like most of the early forms, are of the
"unicursal" type; that is, they have only one path, without
loops or branches. It seems most likely that such
mazes would be constructed either of flower-beds or of
some low-growing shrubs, such as box. If constructed of
high hedges the pattern would be invisible, except from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
a superior eminence, and they would afford but a poor
sort of entertainment to the visitor, who would have
nothing to do but to follow the path until he came to a
full stop, and then retrace his steps. Nevertheless there
is no doubt that some of them were made in this way.
On the other hand the flower-bed labyrinth was not
necessarily unicursal, as we may see from the plans of
De Vries.</p>

<div id="ip_107" class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img id="Fig_79" src="images/i_168.jpg" width="500" height="491" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 79.</span>&mdash;Maze Design by Adam Islip, 1602.</div></div>

<p>The actual form of the unicursal type of labyrinth was,
in all the earlier designs, whether circular or square, in
very close agreement with the classic model, but in later
designs monotony was avoided by means of some ingenious
modifications. One of the earliest of these is shown
in <a href="#Fig_79">Fig.&nbsp;79</a>, which is copied from a very rare book called
"The Orchard and The Garden," gathered from French
and Dutch sources and published by Adam Islip in 1602.
<a href="#Fig_80">Fig.&nbsp;80</a> shows one of several specimens which are given
in a Dutch book of about half a century later, "Nederlantze
Hesperides," by J. Commelyn (1676). It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
perhaps as likely, however, that these were intended as
designs for a hedge maze, or "Doolhof," as the Dutch
call it.</p>

<p>The box-edged paths of "Queen Mary's Bower" on
the island of Inchmahome, by the Lake of Menteith,
Stirlingshire, may mark the site of a former dwarf-box
labyrinth. Tradition maintains that the maze was made
for Mary Queen of Scots when she was staying there as
a child. The original maze-pattern, if such existed, is lost
by reason of the depredations of relic hunters, who for
many years laid the bower under contribution and so
denuded it that it had to be entirely replanted some fifty
or sixty years ago. The box shrubs with which it was
repaired, however, are said to have been taken from the
gardens of Cardross, where they had been reared from
cuttings derived from the original bower. They have now
grown to a height of several feet, and the bower no doubt
presents a very different appearance from that which it
had in the days of the ill-starred Mary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
It consists of a winding box-bordered walk leading to
a central thorn-bush, the whole affair being oval in outline,
about thirty yards in circumference and surrounded
by a paling. Close at hand, and enclosed within a square
stone wall, is Queen Mary's garden, containing at the
centre an old box tree which is affirmed to have been
planted by the little princess herself.</p>

<p>Another Scottish relic which is said to mark the site
of an old terrace maze is that near Stirling Castle, known
since the fourteenth century as the "Round Tabill" or
the "King's Knot."</p>

<p>There is a "Queen Mary's Bower," by the way, in the
gardens at Hampton Court, but this is only a straight
walk shaded by an avenue of pollarded elms, which forms
a sort of verdant tunnel. It is situated at the summit of a
bank rising above one side of the King's Privy Garden.
An old tower planted with shrubs at Chatsworth bears
the same name.</p>

<p>We shall have occasion to refer to "bowers" again
later on, in another connection. The present mention of
them forms a convenient transition from the subject of
garden labyrinths to that of <i>hedge mazes</i>.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE TOPIARY LABYRINTH, OR HEDGE MAZE</span></h2>

<p>The art of trimming hedges of evergreens is of great
antiquity; probably it is almost as old as horticulture itself.</p>

<p>The Romans made much use of the services of the
<i>topiarius</i>, or hedge-trimmer&mdash;he is referred to by Cicero
and other writers&mdash;and it is quite possible that they had
shrubs or bushes trained to enclose winding paths in the
manner of a hedge maze.</p>

<p>In Pliny's "Natural History" (Book XVI, Ch. 33)
the cypress is spoken of as being clipped and trimmed
to form hedges or lengthened out in various designs for
ornamental purposes. In Book XV he tells us that a
shrub called <i>taxa</i> is also used in ornamental gardening,
from which we might conclude that the yew (<i>taxus</i>) was
intended. From the description in the context, however,
it is more likely that Pliny was speaking of a plant something
like our "butcher's broom" (<i>Ruscus aculeatus</i>). He
also mentions the box and a species of laurel as being
suitable for this kind of work.</p>

<p>A hint of something like a hedge maze is given in one
of the epistles of the younger Pliny, where he describes
the gardens of his <i>villa</i> in Tuscany. He speaks of having
a <i>hippodromus</i>, a kind of circus consisting of many paths
separated by box hedges and ornamented with topiary
work.</p>

<p>We do not, however, find any actual description of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
an indubitable hedge maze in the works of the classic
writers. Amongst monastic manuscripts of the middle
ages occur a few passages which have been thought to
refer to something of the kind. For instance Henry,
Abbot of Clairvaux, in speaking metaphorically of labyrinthine
entanglements, says, "Non habent certos aditus,
semitas ambulant circulares, et in quodam fraudium labyrintho
monstra saevissima reconduntur" ("They have no
definite approaches, but wander about in circular sidetracks,
and most savage monsters are concealed in their
labyrinth of deceptions"); but he may very well have been
alluding simply to the traditional Cretan Labyrinth and
not to actual constructions of his own period.</p>

<p>A perhaps more striking passage is that in a "History
of the Counts of Guines, <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 800 to 1200," by Lambert
of Ardres (<i>Lambertus Ardensis</i>), who lived in the twelfth
and thirteenth centuries. Speaking of the building of a
large residence at Ardres for Count Arnold, in the twelfth
century, he says:</p>

<p>"Quam quidem Broburgensis artifex vel carpentarius,
in hujus artis ingenio parum discrepans a Dedalo fabrefecit
et carpentavit nomina Lodevicus et de ea fere inextricabilem
fecit laberinthum et effigiavit, penus penori,
cameram camerae, diversorium diversorio concludens
..."; that is to say, a certain workman named Louis of
Bourbourg, with a skill in woodwork very little different
from that of Daedalus, was employed in building the house
and made there a nearly inextricable labyrinth, containing
recess within recess, room within room, turning
within turning. Here again the description hardly answers
to that of a hedge maze, but rather indicates an
elaborate architectural structure and probably refers to
nothing more than a large wooden house.</p>

<p>The common belief that our own King Henry II concealed
his paramour "the fair Rosamond" within a maze
at Woodstock may possibly, as sceptical historians aver,
have no firmer foundations than that afforded by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
imaginative efforts of mediaeval romancers, but from
what we have just quoted it is evident that contrivances
of the kind described in the legend may have been in
existence not only in Henry's time but even in the
previous century. In view of the great popularity of
the story throughout succeeding generations we cannot
altogether ignore it, but we will discuss it more conveniently
in a later chapter.</p>

<p>The maze was introduced into the Low Countries,
according to a book on Architecture in Belgium, some
time during the thirteenth century, but this statement
may be merely an inference from Lambert's History
quoted above.</p>

<p>In France, as we have already seen, the pavement labyrinths
were sometimes known as "dédales" or "maisons
de Dédalus," in reference of course to the "house"
built by Daedalus for the Minotaur, and in the fourteenth
and fifteenth centuries we find the same titles
applied to mazes formed of shrubs. Charles V, in the
fourteenth century, is said to have laid out a <i>maison de
Dédale</i> in the gardens of the Hôtel de St. Paul in Paris.</p>

<p>Of interest on this point is an Order of the Court of
the Duchy of Anjou, dated September 18, 1477, in
which the people of the Duchy were required to pay
twelve <i>livres</i> to the keeper of King Réné's castle at Baugé
"pour la nourriture des ouyseaux et nestoyer les espèces
qu'il a en garde ... et <i>reffaire le Dédalus</i> qui est és
jardrins dudit lieu de Baugé."</p>

<p>We also read of a <i>dédalus</i> in the park of Louise de
Savoie in 1513.</p>

<p>A sixteenth-century maze is depicted in a landscape
by Tintoretto which is exhibited in the Queen's Private
Chamber at Hampton Court Palace (No. 524 [787]). In
the centre of the maze are seen four ladies seated at a
table, their attendants standing by. In the background
is the palace to which the maze and surrounding pleasure-grounds
evidently appertain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
Hans Holbein, an early contemporary of Tintoretto,
is also said to have painted a maze of this description.</p>

<p>Many mazes at that time were planned by the Italian
architect Serlio, one of whose designs is shown in <a href="#Fig_81">Fig.&nbsp;81</a>.</p>

<div id="ip_113" class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img id="Fig_81" src="images/i_174.jpg" width="500" height="495" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 81.</span>&mdash;Maze Design by J. Serlio (Sixteenth Century).</div></div>

<p>The late sixteenth century furnishes abundant evidence
of the growing taste for the topiary labyrinth in
the architectural works of Androuet du Cerceau, one of
the great builders of the French Renaissance and architect
to Catherine de Medici. We are bound to say, however,
that the assertion of Horace Walpole, in his "Essay on
Modern Gardening," to the effect that in Du Cerceau's
works there is scarcely a ground plot without both a
round and a square maze, is not borne out by reference
to such editions as are generally available.</p>

<p>Du Cerceau's sketches of the mazes at Charleval and
in the Palace garden of the Archbishop of Rouen at
Gaillon&mdash;with modifications necessitated by the extreme
roughness of the original blocks&mdash;are shown in <a href="#Fig_82">Figs.&nbsp;82</a>,
<a href="#Fig_83">83 and 84</a>.</p>

<p>One of the best-known gardens of the Elizabethan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
period was that made about 1560 for Lord Burleigh, or
Burghley, at Theobalds in Hertfordshire. It was described
by a contemporary as being "large and square,
having all its walls covered with Sillery and a beautiful
<i>jet d'eau</i> in the centre." At the end was a small mount
called the Mount of Venus, placed in the midst of a labyrinth,
"upon the whole, one of the most beautiful spots
in the world." The house and gardens, John Evelyn tells
us in his Memoirs, under date April 15, 1643, were
"demolish'd by the rebels."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
A plan of this labyrinth is shown in <a href="#Fig_85">Fig.&nbsp;85</a>. Theobalds
was afterwards transferred by Burleigh's son, the
Earl of Salisbury, to King James the First, in exchange
for another noble seat in the same county, Hatfield
House, still held by the present Marquis of Salisbury.</p>

<div id="ip_115" class="figcenter" style="width: 499px;"><img id="Fig_85" src="images/i_176.jpg" width="499" height="500" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 85.</span>&mdash;Maze at Theobalds, Herts. (After Trollope.)</div></div>

<p>In the grounds to the rear of the latter mansion is to
be seen at the present day one of the finest examples of
a hedge maze, which, although of fairly modern construction,
probably replaced an earlier specimen.</p>

<p>Our photograph, <a href="#Fig_86">Fig.&nbsp;86</a> (see Frontispiece), was taken,
by kind permission, from the roof of Hatfield House.
The hedge is of tall, thick yew throughout, and is perfectly
formed, without any of those thin, straggly growths
in the lower portion which, by tempting the unscrupulous
maze-trotter to burst through them, soon necessitate
renewal or unsightly patching.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
The maze is 174 ft. in length and 108 ft. in width,
and has two entrances (or exits), one at each end. The
basin which formerly occupied the centre was replaced
some years ago by a block of yew surmounted by topiary
figures. <a href="#Fig_87">Fig.&nbsp;87</a> shows the maze in plan.</p>

<div id="ip_116" class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img id="Fig_87" src="images/i_177.jpg" width="500" height="362" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 87.</span>&mdash;Maze at Hatfield House, Herts. Plan. (W.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;M.)</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
From the beautifully turfed level above the maze, or
from the parterre terrace above that, one can overlook
the hedges and enjoy, if so inclined, occasional glimpses
of ensnared and perplexed visitors.</p>

<p>The type of hedge maze exemplified here, in which
the paths are bounded by hedges of uniform thickness,
is only one development. Another type arose in the late
seventeenth century in which serpentinous footpaths
penetrated blocks of shrubs or dense thickets. In some
cases limes or hornbeams were "plashed," <i>i.e.</i>, their
branches were so trained and intertwined as to form a
continuous wall of verdure. In other cases the intervals
between the paths were filled with loose aggregations of
flowering shrubs and evergreens; such an arrangement
as this was usually termed a "wilderness." (The term
"plashing," by the way, should not be confused with
"pleaching," which merely signified the process of ordinary
trimming).</p>

<p>In practically all types of maze it became the fashion
to relieve the monotony of the walks by placing statues,
vases, seats, fountains, and other ornaments at various
points. This kind of thing reached a climax of extravagance
in the latter part of the seventeenth century, when
J. Hardouin-Mansart constructed for Louis XIV the
famous labyrinth in the smaller park at Versailles. This
labyrinth is described in a book, now very rare, entitled
"Labyrinte de Versailles," by C. Perrault, printed at the
royal press, Paris, in 1677, and illustrated by Sebastien
le Clerc. Our illustrations, <a href="#Fig_88">Figs.&nbsp;88</a>, <a href="#Fig_89">89</a>, <a href="#Fig_90">90</a> and <a href="#Fig_91">91</a>, are
selected from the book in question and show respectively
the plan of the labyrinth and three of the thirty-nine
groups of hydraulic statuary representing the fables of
Aesop. At the entrance to the labyrinth were placed
symbolical statues of Aesop and Cupid, the latter holding
in one hand a ball of thread. Each of the speaking
characters represented in the fable groups emitted a
jet of water, representing speech, and each group was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
accompanied by an engraved plate displaying more or
less appropriate verses by the poet de Benserade.</p>

<p>We reproduce le Clerc's engravings of the groups
illustrating respectively the fables of "The Hare and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
the Tortoise," "The Fox and the Crow," and "The Snake
and the Porcupine." The water for all these elaborate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
waterworks was conveyed from the Seine by a wonderful
contrivance called the "Machine de Marli," constructed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
by Swalm Renkin between 1675 and 1682. It is said to
have cost the equivalent of £8,000,000 and contained
fourteen water-wheels driving 253 pumps, some of
which worked at a distance of three-quarters of a mile.</p>

<p>The labyrinth was destroyed in 1775 and its site is
now occupied by the "Bosquet de la Reine."</p>

<p>The "Dial-garden" at Friar Park, Henley-on-Thames,
is laid out on the plan of the Versailles labyrinth, but in
place of the statuary groups are thirty-nine sun-dials, each
having its motto or epigram. Adjoining it is a maze of
original and ingenious design.</p>

<p>The Versailles example was only one of several well-known
mazes which existed
in or around Paris at that
time. Evelyn, who spent
some years in Paris, from
1643 onwards, remarks on
the design and trimness of
the box-hedge designs in the
gardens of the Luxembourg
and on the "labyrinth of
cypresse" at the Tuileries,
no doubt designed by Du
Cerceau (<a href="#Fig_92">Fig.&nbsp;92</a>). In another account of the Tuileries
labyrinth, however, it is described as being made entirely
of bent cherry trees. It was ultimately swept away by
Le Nôtre to make room for enlarged parterres.</p>

<p>There is still a labyrinth in the Jardin des Plantes,
formerly the Jardin du Roi, but it is of rather feeble design.</p>

<p>Another noted French maze was that constructed by
M. Gabriel at Choisy-le-Roi (<a href="#Fig_93">Fig.&nbsp;93</a>). One was designed
for the gardens of Chantilly by Le Nôtre, but exists to-day
only as an engraving on a stone in the park (<a href="#Fig_94">Fig.&nbsp;94</a>).
Madame de Sévigné, in a letter of June 1, 1689, mentions
one at Les Rochers, her seat in Brittany, and we

In most European countries the fashion had obtained
a hold either before or during the seventeenth century,
and we can usually be sure of finding a few drawings of
mazes in any horticultural book of that period.</p>

<p>One of these (<a href="#Fig_105">Fig.&nbsp;105</a>) is rather suggestive of the
Saffron Walden turf maze, whilst another (<a href="#Fig_101">Fig.&nbsp;101</a>)
is reminiscent of the Rheims pavement labyrinth. At
Enghien, in Belgium, the gardens of the château where
the Duke of Arenburg entertained Voltaire contained a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
maze, as well as a "mechanical island" and various other
horticultural toys.</p>

<p>In Spain, as elsewhere, the hedge maze attained great
popularity. In the magnificent gardens of the Alcazar at
Seville may still be seen the labyrinth laid out in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>

<p>As regards Italy, we read that even the Pope himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
Clement X, took pleasure in watching the endeavours of
his domestics to extricate themselves from the maze of
tall box hedges which adorned his garden at Altieri.
Evelyn, in 1646, describing his visit to Vicenza, remarks
of the gardens of Count Ulmarini, or Vilmarini,
outside the town, "Here is likewise a most inextricable
labyrinth."</p>

<p>Sir Philip Skippon, describing his own visit to Vicenza
in 1663, refers to the gardens as those of Count Valmarana,
and mentions "a labyrinth of myrtle hedges."
Skippon also speaks of labyrinths in the gardens of the
Duke of Bavaria at Munich.</p>

<p>The Dutch gardeners made a great feature of the <i>doolhof</i>,
typical examples being those at the Duke of Portland's
château at Sorgvliet, near the Hague, at Gunterstein
(<a href="#Fig_107">Figs.&nbsp;107</a> and <a href="#Fig_108">108</a>), and at the Palace of Loo, the
Dutch home of William and Mary (<a href="#Fig_109">Fig.&nbsp;109</a>). Our illustration
of the last-named is taken from Dr. W. Harris's
book "The King's Palace and Gardens at Loo" (1699).
It will be seen that the maze to the left is described as a
"wilderness," as is also the structure to the extreme right,
but whereas the latter certainly presents little of a labyrinthine
appearance, the former is evidently a hedge
maze, although perhaps loosely drawn. Harris uses the
terms "maze" and "wilderness" interchangeably. He
says that the King's labyrinth was formed of clipped
hedges with sandy walks between, while the Queen's
was decorated with fountains and statues. William the
Third exercised his taste for this kind of embellishment
also in the grounds of his English palaces. His gardeners,
George London and Henry Wise, have left us one which,
although of no great complexity, has become world-famous,
namely, the specimen which forms part of the
"Wilderness" in the gardens of Hampton Court Palace.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE TOPIARY LABYRINTH, OR HEDGE MAZE (<i>continued</i>)</span></h2>

<p>The Hampton Court maze (<a href="#Fig_110">Fig.&nbsp;110</a>) was constructed
in 1690 and in all probability displaced an older maze, a
relic of Wolsey's time. The maze is situated close to the
Bushy Park entrance. Defoe speaks of it as a "labrynth,"
and tells us that the "Wilderness," of which it forms
part, replaced the old orchard of the palace.</p>

<p>It is of no great complexity, but, as may be seen from
<a href="#Fig_111">Fig.&nbsp;111</a>, is of a neat and symmetrical pattern, with quite
sufficient of the puzzle about it to sustain interest and to
cause amusement but without a needless and tedious
excess of intricacy. The area occupied by it is rather
more than a quarter of an acre&mdash;not a great amount of
space, but enough to accommodate about half a mile of
total pathway. The longest side of the maze measures
222 ft.</p>

<p>Various diagrams of the maze have been published,
some of them very incorrect and therefore misleading.
Our sketch was made on the spot and represents at any
rate the present (1922) disposition of the paths and
hedges. The gate almost opposite the entrance should
normally be closed. It is for the purpose of affording the
gardener or attendant direct access to the "goal" and its
approaches, or occasionally for facilitating the release of
impatient visitors; if left open it spoils the fun. The goal is
provided with two bench seats, each shaded by a leafy tree.</p>

The hedge was at first composed entirely of hornbeam,
but, like most of its kind, it has required renewal at
various points from time to time, and this has not always
been carried out with the appropriate material. The
result, as may be seen in our photograph, is a patchwork
of privet, hornbeam, yew, holly, hawthorn and sycamore.
It is nevertheless questionable whether the lack of uniformity
in this respect causes any grief to the bulk of its
visitors. The maze is as popular as ever, and in the
financial year 1919&ndash;20 brought in a revenue of nearly
£775, which exceeded the estimate of the Office of Works
by £325!</p>

<div id="ip_129" class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img id="Fig_111" src="images/i_202.jpg" width="500" height="251" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 111.</span>&mdash;Maze at Hampton Court. Plan. (W.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;M.)</div></div>

<p>Long may it remain! It may be a sad sight to the "highbrows"
of horticulture, but to the unsophisticated many
it is a never-failing source of innocent merriment. Those
who incline to deplore the perpetuation of these "topiary
toys" should spend an hour or two in the Hampton
Court maze on a sunny holiday and witness the undiluted
delight which it affords to scores and hundreds of children,
not to mention a fair sprinkling of their elders.</p>

<p>The circular Troy-town or "Plan-de-Troy," formed
of tall espaliers, which formerly co-existed with the
present maze (see <a href="#Fig_112">Fig.&nbsp;112</a>), has long been replaced by a
sunken rockery, the path of which, however, is of a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
meandering character and has earned from visitors the
title of "The Little Maze" (<a href="#Fig_113">Fig.&nbsp;113</a>). A topiary work of
similar title, "The Siege of Troy," was one of William's
pet horticultural adornments at Kensington Palace. It is
said to have been a verdant representation of military
defence works, cut yew and variegated holly being
"taught," as Walpole says, "to imitate the lines, angles,
bastions, scarps and counter-scarps of regular fortifications."</p>

<p>The rather curious unicursal maze of three meanders
shown in <a href="#Fig_114">Fig.&nbsp;114</a> is usually, <i>e.g.</i>, in the "Encyclopaedia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
Britannica," attributed to London and Wise, and certainly
it appears in a book which was issued by them in
1706 under the title of "The Solitary Gardiner" (subsequently
published by Joseph Carpenter as "The Retir'd
Gardner"), but this work is mainly a translation from an
earlier French book, "Le Jardinier Solitaire," by Louis
Liger of Auxerre, in which also the figure appears.
Various other horticultural writers of the period make
use of the same design.</p>

<div id="ip_131" class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img id="Fig_114" src="images/i_208.jpg" width="500" height="341" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 114.</span>&mdash;Labyrinth Design by L. Liger (circ. 1700).</div></div>

<p>"A Labyrinth," says the text, "is a Place cut into
several Windings, set off with Horn-beam, to divide
them from one another.... The most valuable Labyrinths
are always those that wind most, as that of Versailles,
the contrivance of which has been wonderfully
lik'd by all that have seen it" (<i>chacun à son goût!</i>). "The
Palisades, of which Labyrinths ought to be compos'd,
should be ten, twelve, or fifteen foot high; some there
are that are no higher than one can lean on, but those are
not the finest. The Walls of a Labyrinth ought to be kept
roll'd, and the Horn-beams in them shear'd, in the shape
of Half-moons."</p>

<p>As for the allurements of the much-winding labyrinths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
of the Versailles type the reader will no doubt form his
own opinion. Their popularity at that time is demonstrated
by the great number of designs of this nature
which we find in such books as, for example, those
of Batty Langley, a few of whose plans we reproduce
(<a href="#Fig_115">Figs.&nbsp;115</a> and <a href="#Fig_116">116</a>).</p>

<p>An example of the "block" type of labyrinth was that
at Trinity College, Oxford, of which a view is seen in an
early eighteenth-century engraving (<a href="#Fig_117">Fig.&nbsp;117</a>), from the
"Oxonia depicta" of W. Williams. It was destroyed in
1813. Similar arrangements appear in several of the
engravings of country seats, <i>e.g.</i>, those of Belvoir Castle,
Boughton, and Exton Park, in J. Kip's "Britannia Illustrata,"
1724. In this work also appear mazes of the
more familiar type, as, for example, in the engravings of
Badminton and Wrest Park (<a href="#Fig_118">Fig.&nbsp;118</a>).</p>

<p>The idea of Batty Langley and of the Versailles artist
seems to have been not so much that of puzzling the
visitor as of providing an entertaining and diversified
promenade, but with many maze-architects the object was
to provide as much bewilderment as the space available
permitted. This is frankly avowed by Stephen Switzer
in his somewhat tedious "Ichnographia Rustica," published
in 1742. He gives the design shown in <a href="#Fig_119">Fig.&nbsp;119</a>,
and describes it as "a labyrinth of single hedges or banks,
<i>after the ancient manner</i>."</p>

<div id="ip_132" class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img id="Fig_117" src="images/i_211.jpg" width="500" height="358" alt="" /><div class="caption">Fig. 117. Gardens of Trinity College, Oxford, with Labyrinth. (W. Williams, 1732).</div></div>

<p>He speaks of the object of a labyrinth as being to
provide "an intricate and difficult Labour to find out the
Centre, and to be (as the Vulgar commonly like it for)
so intricate, as to lose one's self therein, and to meet with
as great a Number of Stops therein and Disappointments
as possible; I thought the best way to accomplish it was
to make a dubious Choice of which way to take at the
very Entrance and Beginning it self, in order to find out
the Centre, at which we are to end at B. into a little
Arbour cradled over; for which Reason there is in the
very first coming in, in the Centre, where the Grass-Plot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
and Statue are design'd at A. six different Entrances
whereof there is but one that leads to the centre and that
is attended with some difficulties and a great many stops."</p>

<p>He might have added, "... like unto my own literary
style."</p>

<div id="ip_133" class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img id="Fig_119" src="images/i_212.jpg" width="500" height="337" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 119.</span>&mdash;Maze Design by S. Switzer (1742).</div></div>

<p>A labyrinth of a most fantastic character is said to
have occupied a large area in the palace garden of the
Prince of Anhalt, in Germany. It was allegorical and
was intended to typify the course of human life. It was
composed not only of hedges, but of rocks and trees,
streams and caverns, and tortuous deeply cut paths,
which were for the most part covered in, with very scanty
illumination. At every other turn the visitor was pulled
up by some puzzling or terrifying allegory, or some
didactic inscription after the manner of those which
adorn the rocks at Tilly Whim, on the Dorset coast.
By way of compensation he was refreshed here and there
by the sight of a choice example of the sculptor's art, or
a flowery dell, or some verdurous presentation of the
architect's idea of Elysium. As in the case of Versailles,
expense seems to have been no obstacle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
At H.M. Records Office is preserved in "Survey
No. 72" a rather pathetic document headed "A Survey
of the Manor of Wymbledon <i>alias</i> Wimbleton, with the
Rights, Members and Appurtenances thereof, lying and
being in the Countie of Surrey, late Parcell of the Possessions
of Henrietta Maria, the Relict and late Queene
of Charles Stuart, late King of England, made and taken
... in the Moneth of November 1649." A transcript
of the document was communicated to "Archaeologia"
in 1792 by John Caley, F.A.S., the following portion
being worth noting in connection with our present
subject:</p>

<p>"... On the South syde of the sayd turfed tarras
there are planted one great maze, and one wilderness,
which being severed with one gravelled Alley, in or near
to the midle of the sayd turfed tarras, sets forth the maze
to lie towards the east, and the wilderness towards the
west; the maze consists of young trees, wood and sprayes
of a good growth and height, cutt into severall meanders,
circles, semicircles, wyndings and intricate turnings, the
walks or intervalls whereof are all grass plotts; this maze,
as it is now ordered, adds very much to the worth of the
upper levell ... which maze and wilderness over and
besides the trees thereof, which are hereafter valewed
amongst the other trees of the sayd upper garden and the
materialls of the sayd two shadowe or summer houses,
wee valew to bee worth £90.0.0."</p>

<p>Whether the maze referred to was afterwards
destroyed is not clear, but possibly it was preserved and
was identical with that mentioned by the writer of the
"Encyclopaedia Britannica" article as having formerly
existed at Wimbledon House, the seat of Earl Spencer,
which was conjectured to have been laid out by Brown in
the eighteenth century. ("Capability" Brown, we may
note, was no lover of mazes, though his official residence
at Hampton Court adjoined the maze.)</p>

<div id="ip_134" class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img id="Fig_118" src="images/i_214.jpg" width="500" height="355" alt="" /><div class="caption">Fig. 118. Wrest Park, Bedfordshire, with two Mazes. (J. Kip, 1720)</div></div>

<p>There are records of various other old mazes in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
immediate vicinity of London, apart from the "tea-garden"
mazes of the last century. Pepys in 1666 speaks
of "several labyrinths" in the gardens of Lord Brooke
at Hackney, and Evelyn in 1700 mentions mazes
at Marden, Surrey. Sutton Court also contained a fine
example.</p>

<p>There was one in Tothill (or Tuttle) Fields, Westminster,
in the seventeenth century, and perhaps earlier, for
it is mentioned with familiarity in a play written by John
Cooke in 1614, "Greene's Tu Quoque; or the Cittie
Gallant; a Play of Much Humour," wherein one of the
characters challenges another to a duel:</p>

<blockquote class="in4">

<p><i>Staines.</i> I accept it; the meeting place?</p>

<p><i>Spendall.</i> Beyond the Maze in Tuttle.</p></blockquote>

<p>The maze was renovated or remade in 1672, as
shown by an entry in the Churchwardens' Accounts of
St. Margaret, Westminster:</p>

<p class="p1 center b1">
"<i>Item</i>, to Mr. William Brewer, for making a maze in
Tuttlefields <span class="in2"> £2.0.0."</span>
</p>

<p>It was well known to John Aubrey, the antiquary and
naturalist whose reference to turf mazes we have already
quoted. In his "Remaines," 1686&ndash;7, he says:</p>

<p>"There is a maze at this day in Tuthill Fields,
Westminster, &amp; much frequented in summer-time in
fair afternoons."</p>

<p>According to Mr. J.&nbsp;E. Smith's "Parochial Memorials
of St. John the Baptist, Westminster," Tothill Fields
were at one time known as "Tuttle-in-the-Maze."</p>

<p>In the large view of London and Westminster engraved
by Wenceslaus Hollar (1607&ndash;1677) there is
shown in the middle of Tothill Fields a clump of trees
surrounding a sort of shelter, like a band-stand, but
no sort of labyrinthine design is visible.</p>

<p>Another London maze mentioned by Aubrey, and one
which has left its remembrance in the present-day nomenclature
of the locality (Maze Pond), is that of Southwark.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
"At Southwarke," says Aubrey, "was a Maze which is
converted into Buildings bearing that name."</p>

<p>In another place he says, "On the south side of Tooley-street
a little westward from Burnaby-street is a Street
called the <span class="smcap">Maes</span> or <span class="smcap">Maze</span>, Eastward from the Borough
(another name for Labyrinth). I believe we received these
Mazes from our Danish Ancestors...." This latter
observation is one which seems to have been entirely overlooked
by subsequent archaeologists and antiquaries,
but its significance will be seen when we come to consider
the subject of "stone labyrinths."</p>

<p>It is clear from the last phrase, that in this case
Aubrey had in mind turf mazes rather than hedge
mazes, and we are in doubt as to whether the Southwark
maze was of the former or the latter species.</p>

<p>The Abbot of Battle had a residence there after the
dissolution of the monasteries, and it has been stated that
he had a maze in his garden, or, alternatively, that his
garden paths were laid out in such an intricate manner as
to suggest the name. But there are records of the name
being applied to the locality before the dissolution of the
monasteries, and it is quite possible that there was once
a turf maze in the neighbourhood, perhaps before the
abbot's time. According to a footnote in Strickland's
"Lives of the Queens of England," the maze in Southwark
once formed part of the garden of the Princess
Mary Tudor, but the authority for this statement is not
quoted.</p>

<p>Maze Hill, Greenwich, is said to derive its name
from the former existence of a maze, traces of which
are claimed to have been found near the entrance to
Morden College, Blackheath. The name was formerly
spelt Maize Hill and at one time Mease or Meaze Hill.
We shall have a word to say about place-names towards
the end of this book, but we may remark in passing that
inferences as to the past existence of an object based solely
upon a current homonymous place-name are obviously
unsound.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">THE TOPIARY LABYRINTH, OR HEDGE MAZE</span> (<i>continued</i>)</span>

<span class="subhead"><i>Latter-day Developments</i></span></h2>

<p>Towards the end of the eighteenth century the taste for
mazes in private gardens had to some extent declined,
but as an adjunct to places of public amusement the
topiary labyrinth was still in great demand.</p>

<p>"Pleasure gardens" of the Ranelagh and Vauxhall
type were then greatly in vogue, not only in the metropolis
but in most of the fashionable health resorts, and,
although it is only in comparatively few cases that we
have definite records of their having possessed a maze,
there is no doubt that very many were in existence,
though probably most have since disappeared.</p>

<p>A favourite resort with dwellers in the north of
London, up to about a century ago, was White Conduit
House, in Islington, and here a maze formed one of the
principal attractions.</p>

<p>In Harrow Road, N.W., No. 6 Chichester Place
marks the site of a minor public garden called "The
Maze," which flourished up to about the middle of last
century.</p>

<p>Another northern pleasure garden which is recorded
as possessing a maze was "New Georgia," in Turners
Wood, near the Spaniards, Hampstead.</p>

<p>South of the Thames the celebrated Beulah Spa had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
a maze, which, together with that at Hampton Court,
is referred to by Dickens in his "Sketches by Boz."</p>

<p>Other well-known "tea-garden" mazes are those at
the Crystal Palace and at the Rosherville Gardens,
Gravesend.</p>

<p>A maze was erected at the request of the Prince
Consort, in or about the year 1862, in the gardens of the
Royal Horticultural Society at South Kensington. It was
designed by Lieut. W.&nbsp;H. Nesfield, R.N., who relinquished
a naval career to become a very successful
gardener. <a href="#Fig_120">Fig.&nbsp;120</a> shows the plan of this maze as given
in the R.H.S. official guide to the gardens in 1864. A
statue of Galatea adorned the "goal."</p>

<p>This plan differs in some respects from Nesfield's
original design, which was slightly simpler and provided
for a central fountain and basin. The figure which illustrates
the "Britannica" article&mdash;and which has been
copied into a popular book on puzzles, accompanied by
the remark that it is "a feeble thing"&mdash;unfortunately
departs from the official plan in certain small but important
details; it allows of an almost direct passage from a
third external opening to the circular goal. The maze
ultimately went to ruin and its site has long been built
upon.</p>

<p>The maze in the beautiful little gardens at Saffron
Walden which were presented to the public nearly a
century ago by Mr. L. Fry, M.P., and are known as
Bridge End Gardens, is still in excellent condition, although
suffering in places from the illicit short-cuts made
by impatient visitors. It is locally believed to be a replica
of that at Hampton Court, but is of very different plan
and is, in fact, much more elaborate. Our photographs,
<a href="#Fig_121">Figs.&nbsp;121</a> and <a href="#Fig_122">122</a>, were taken from the pulpit-like erection
at one end of the central enclosure, looking roughly
towards the south and the north respectively.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that a person standing on the erection
is precluded from mapping out the maze therefrom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
by reason of the tall topiary upgrowths at various points,
designed, no doubt, with this object. This maze is
situated within a few hundred yards of the turf maze
which we noticed in a previous chapter.</p>

<div id="ip_139" class="figcenter" style="width: 348px;"><img id="Fig_120" src="images/i_220.jpg" width="348" height="500" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 120.</span>&mdash;Maze by W.&nbsp;H. Nesfield, in R.H.S. Gardens, South
Kensington, circ. 1862. (From R.H.S. Guide.)</div></div>

<p>Another modern hedge maze in the same county is
that in the grounds of Mistley Place, Manningtree, the
residence of E.&nbsp;M. Jackson, Esq., M.A., who has kindly
furnished the writer with some details concerning it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
The maze was planted about fifty years ago, but unfortunately
the choice of material was not of the most
judicious, for, while the major portion is of beech, young
oaks were planted in the outer circle and these have now
grown up into large trees, overshadowing and ruining
the neighbouring portions of the hedge, so that it is now
difficult to trace the plan. Only the inner circles remain
complete.</p>

<p>In the adjacent county of Suffolk there is another
maze of about the same age but of very different pattern,
at Somerleyton Hall, the seat of Lord Somerleyton (<a href="#Fig_123">Fig.&nbsp;123</a>). The hedges in this case are of yew and are of great
thickness, about six or seven feet in height. At the
points marked "A" are situated two beautiful golden
Irish yews. Clipped yews provide interesting variety at
the points marked "B," and a little pagoda crowns the
central knoll, approached by grassy ramps.</p>

<p>There is a hexagonal maze, of some complexity, in the
splendid gardens of the Hon. J. Egerton Warburton at
Arley Hall, Cheshire. It is formed of lime trees, planted
about half a century ago.</p>

<p>We may also mention one, of circular and rather simple
though distinctive design, at Belton House, the residence
of Earl Brownlow, near Grantham, Lincolnshire.</p>

<p>In Gloucestershire there is one in the grounds of
Sudeley Castle, the home of H.&nbsp;D. Brocklehurst, Esq.,
J.P., where, according to Kelly's county directory, "the
old pleasaunce, with its paths and fountain, was discovered
in 1850 and now forms part of the garden."</p>

<p>In Nottinghamshire there is one, planted by Colonel
Thos. Coke in the 'fifties, at Debdale Hall, Mansfield
Woodhouse (F.&nbsp;N. Ellis, Esq., J.P.).</p>

<p>Mr. W.&nbsp;W. Rouse Ball, in his "Mathematical Recreations
and Essays," gives a drawing of an elaborate
maze which he has erected in his own garden, presumably
at Cambridge.</p>

<p>Possibly there are many others in the seclusion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
large country gardens, but, as the owners of such contrivances
are inclined to consider them as relics of a
bygone and discredited fashion, it is only by chance or
by individual enquiries that information concerning
them can be obtained, and it is of course impracticable
to take an unofficial census on such a matter. It may be
taken as probable, however, that all the most notable
examples have been enumerated above.</p>

<div id="ip_141" class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img id="Fig_123" src="images/i_224.jpg" width="500" height="482" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 123.</span>&mdash;Maze at Somerleyton Hall, Suffolk. (W.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;M., from
sketch by G.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;G.)</div></div>

<p>In continental countries the occurrence of mazes is as
sporadic as at home. There are said to be some excellent
specimens in the neighbourhood of Barcelona, fragrant,
aromatic, and flowering shrubs being a characteristic
feature of their composition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
As regards Italy, Mr. Inigo Triggs, in his description
of the Castellezo dei Arconati, near Milan ("The Art
of Garden Design in Italy"), mentions two "labyrinths,"
one of which is an extensive work of closely cut hornbeam,
partly laid out as a circular maze, whilst the other
has a number of small enclosures and alcoves with
fountains.</p>

<p>In France well-known mazes are those at the Priory
of St. Michel, Toul, called <i>la Tour du Diable</i>, and at the
Abbaye aux Dames, Caen, as well as the rather poor
specimen at the Jardin des Plantes in Paris, to which we
have already alluded.</p>

<p>A description of the popular Tivoli Gardens in Vienna,
towards the close of the last century, refers to a labyrinth
situated below a terrace from which spectators could
observe the alarms and excursions of the enmeshed
maze-trotters.</p>

<p>In the United States, where very few of the embellishments
of bygone Europe have failed to achieve reproduction,
there is a replica, with some slight modifications,
of the Hampton Court maze. This is situated at
Waltham, Massachusetts, on the property of Miss
Cornelia Warren. It was planted in 1896, and is formed
of thick hedges of arbor vitae, about a thousand shrubs
being employed. The plan follows that of its original
model, but the sharp rear angles of the Hampton Court
design are replaced by rounded curves, and the hedges
adjacent to the central space, which is also rounded, are
correspondingly modified.</p>

<p>There is a pond at the centre and a rustic rostrum
stands before the entrance. The shortest route to the
centre is said to be about one-fifth of a mile in length and
the total length of the paths about one-third of a mile.</p>

<p>A large hedge maze is also to be found at a place called
Cedar Hill&mdash;and no doubt there are many others.</p>

<p>The decline in favour of the maze amongst gardeners
of repute during the latter part of the eighteenth century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
is possibly to be accounted for in great part as the
natural revulsion from the surfeit of elaborate designs
produced in the preceding periods.</p>

<p>"In designing a garden," wrote Lord Kames (Henry
Home), "everything trivial or whimsical ought to be
avoided. Is a labyrinth therefore to be justified? It is a
mere conceit, like that of composing verses in the shape
of an axe or an egg: the walks and hedges may be agreeable,
but in the form of a labyrinth they serve to no end
but to puzzle; a riddle is a conceit not so mean, because
the solution is a proof of sagacity, which affords no aid
to tracing a labyrinth."</p>

<p>This was in his "Elements of Criticism," a work of
which Dr. Johnson remarked: "Sir, this book is a pretty
essay and deserves to be held in some estimation, though
much of it is chimerical." The idea that sagacity affords
no aid in tracing a labyrinth is certainly chimerical, as
we shall see, but persons who incline to austerity in art
will have little hesitation in agreeing with the other remarks
of Lord Kames, even where, further on, he says:
"The gardens of Versailles, executed with boundless
expense by the best artists of the age, are a lasting monument
of a taste the most depraved." Since Lord Kames's
time, however, the gardens of Versailles have been subjected
to considerable alteration, and at the present day
form one of the greatest charms of the environs of
Paris.</p>

<p>The contemporary French poet Delille, author of "Les
Jardins, ou l'Art d'embellir les Paysages," was voicing
the feelings of the times when he wrote:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Des longs alignements si je hais la tristesse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Je hais bien plus encore le cours embarrassé<br /></span>
<span class="i0">D'un sentier qui, pareil à ce serpent blessé,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">En replis convulsifs sans cesse s'entrelace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">De détours redoublés m'inquiète, me lasse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Et, sans variété, brusque et capricieux,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tourmente et le terrain et mes pas et mes yeux."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>
<p class="in0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
From that time onwards the hedge maze has been the
object of much condemnatory criticism and contemptuous
reference, sometimes grounded on a certain amount
of reason, but often enough of the follow-my-leader
type.</p>

<p>Even at the present time there are not wanting gardeners
of influence who would view with equanimity the
entire disappearance of this convoluted mass of evergreens
which dares to offer its antiquated charms in competition
with their latest floricultural triumphs.</p>

<p>And cannot one sympathise to some extent with their
feelings in the matter? When one's whole career has
been devoted to the creation of new forms of plant life
or the improvement of existing forms, achievements
which entail prolonged scientific training and patient
experimenting, constant vigilance and careful selection
of favourable variations, it <i>must</i> be rather galling to be
asked to construct and maintain a meandering row of
commonplace evergreens. One can imagine the case to
be somewhat parallel to that of a highly trained musician
who has just delivered himself of a great sonata and is
asked by a member of his audience for "a descriptive
battle-march!"</p>

<p>Mr. W. Robinson had perhaps experiences of this kind
in mind when he wrote his observations about mazes
in his well-known handbook, "The English Flower
Garden." "The Maze," he says, is "one of the notions
about gardening which arose when people had very
little idea of the dignity and infinite beauty of the garden
flora as we now know it." In the next sentence he refers
to mazes as "ugly frivolities." They should be left, he
says, "for the most part to places of the public tea-garden
kind." Whatever we may think of the justice of these
remarks, we must admit that there is some force in his
objection that "one of its drawbacks is the death and
distortion of the evergreens that go to form its close lines,
owing to the frequent clipping; if clipping be neglected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
the end is still worse, and the whole thing is soon ready
for the fire."</p>

<p>A figure of a maze accompanies this criticism, but it
can hardly be meant to typify the usual conception of a
hedge maze, as it has the appearance of a seventeenth-century
design, possibly intended for a floral labyrinth,
for, apart from a few ornamental excrescences, it is
entirely unicursal.</p>

<p>Although the strictures we have quoted would probably
receive hearty support from a large proportion
of modern gardeners, the maze is still not without its
champions.</p>

<p>In Miss Madeline Agar's very practical book on
"Garden Design," for example, it is treated as a wholly
legitimate embellishment for large gardens, and the fact
of its disfavour amongst present-day horticulturists is
attributed to lack of patience.</p>

<p>A highly original design, with provision for seats, sundials,
and statues, is likewise given, but it must be confessed
that it conveys a flattering assumption of opulence
on the part of the reader, for it certainly does not err on
the side of simplicity.</p>

<p>Let us admit at once that, as a favourite of fashion, the
maze has long since had its day. In every generation the
craving is for novelty, for new forms of expression in all
branches of art. Like every other defunct mode, the
topiary labyrinth is liable to temporary revivals by lovers
of the antique, but there is little reason to hope or to fear
that it will ever again secure a position of any dominance
in the affections of the gardener. The labour involved in
its proper maintenance is alone a sufficient guarantee
against that. The hedges require very frequent trimming,
and sometimes partial renewal, the latter especially in
those cases where unscrupulous visitors are not prevented,
by barbed wire or other means, from short-circuiting
the convolutions. The paths, too, of which
there may be over half a mile, want regular attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
unless we are content to be constantly reminded of Tom
Moore's punning conundrum:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Why is a garden's wildered maze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a young widow, fresh and fair?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because it wants some hand to raze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The weeds which have no business there."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Deciduous plants such as hornbeam and lime give the
maze a sorry appearance during the leafless months of
the year, whilst the slower-growing conifers, yew and
cypress, besides being expensive, necessitate a long waiting
period before the hedges attain a presentable height
and thickness. Box harbours slugs; juniper, holly, and
the various thorn-bushes present inhospitable asperities
which outweigh their other merits&mdash;in short, we may
be certain that whatever material be suggested for the
construction of a maze there will be no lack of objections
wherewith the gardener may buttress his prejudice
against the contrivance in any shape or form.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the maze has its own, almost indefinable,
charms, and we need hardly tremble for its
total extinction until we cease to bear children, even if we
dismiss as decadent sentimentality that romantic instinct
of which some of us cannot quite rid ourselves in maturer
years.</p>

<span class="subhead">STONE LABYRINTHS AND ROCK ENGRAVINGS</span></h2>

<p>In Chapter XII we noticed some of the principal suggestions
which had been made up to a few years ago as to
the origin of our turf mazes, and saw that the question
was one which could not be settled by the study of remains
found in this country alone. Several interesting
facts have been brought to light in other lands since Dr.
Trollope wrote the memoir which has for so many years
been accepted as the standard authority on the subject,
and we shall find that a little consideration of them will
enable us to view the question in a new light.</p>

<p>As long ago as 1838, Dr. E. von Baer, whilst held up
by bad weather on the uninhabited island of Wier, south
of Hochland in the Gulf of Finland, observed a curious
pattern (<a href="#Fig_124">Fig.&nbsp;124</a>) formed in the ground by means of
large pebbles. He also noticed several very similar
arrangements on the southern coast of the peninsula of
Lappland and presented a paper on the subject to the
Academy of St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>In some of these figures the stones employed were
small pebbles, in other instances they were as large as a
child's head, and in one case they were so large that they
required several strong men to lift them. Some of the
figures had nearly disappeared through the action of
moss, earthworms, etc.</p>

<div id="ip_147" class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img id="Fig_124" src="images/i_231.jpg" width="500" height="496" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 124.</span>&mdash;Stone Labyrinth on Wier Island, Gulf of Finland.

<p>In 1877, Dr. J.&nbsp;R. Aspelin, of Helsingfors, drew
attention to the existence of similar figures in Finland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
and on the east coast of Sweden. <a href="#Fig_125">Fig.&nbsp;125</a> shows a form
found by him on an island not far from Borgo, Finland.
He describes some of the figures as having one "centre,"
others two, and others again none at all. They are usually
from ten to fifteen yards in diameter. One large specimen,
nearly twenty yards across (<a href="#Fig_126">Fig.&nbsp;126</a>), at Wisby, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
the Island of Gothland, is of a design very similar to the
circular labyrinth which appears on certain coins of
Knossos. They were generally found on islands or close
to the sea-coast, and were known by various names in
different localities (see p. 150).</p>

<div id="ip_149" class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img id="Fig_126" src="images/i_232.jpg" width="500" height="446" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 126.</span>&mdash;Stone Labyrinth at Wisby, Gothland. (Aspelin.)</div></div>

<p>The fishermen and peasants said that they were used
for children's games, a girl standing at the centre whilst
the boys raced for her along the winding paths; but
Dr. Aspelin pointed out that they were in any case
ancient remains, and thought that the idea might have
originated in the Bronze Age.</p>

<p>Corresponding figures have been found in Iceland,
and a somewhat similar arrangement, consisting of concentric
circles of pebbles, with sometimes a cross at the
centre, has long been known in the province of Brandenburg,
Germany.</p>

<p>It seems to have escaped the notice of most writers
on the subject that long before the nineteenth century
these objects were described by the Swedish antiquarian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
Rudbeck, from whose "Atlantica" (1695) we reproduce
the sketch shown in <a href="#Fig_127">Fig.&nbsp;127</a>.</p>

<p>The names given to these devices in the various localities
in which they occur are of some interest. Around
the Finnish coasts the names <i>Jatulintarha</i> (Giant's Fence)
and <i>Pietarinleikki</i> (St. Peter's Game) predominate. Around
Helsingfors the figures are more frequently spoken of as
"Ruins of Jerusalem," "City of Nineveh," or "Walls of
Jericho." In the neighbourhood of Viborg they are
known as <i>Jätinkatu</i> (Giant's Street), <i>Kivitarha</i> (Stone-fence),
or <i>Lissabon</i>.</p>

<div id="ip_150" class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img id="Fig_127" src="images/i_233.jpg" width="500" height="420" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 127.</span>&mdash;Scandinavian Stone Labyrinth. (O. Rudbeck, 1695.)</div></div>

<p>In Lappland a common term is <i>Babylon</i>; in Iceland,
where the mazes are sometimes formed of earth, the name
applied is <i>Völundarhus</i> (Wieland's, or Weyland's, House).</p>

<p>In Norway and Sweden they are sometimes called
<i>Nunnentarha</i> (Nun's Fence), <i>Jungfrudans</i> (Maiden's
Dance), or <i>Rundborg</i> (Round Castle), and on an island in
the Kattegat the name <i>Trelleborg</i> (The Troll's, or Giant's,
Castle) is found; but more frequently they are known by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
some name akin to our "Troy-town," such as <i>Trojin</i>,
<i>Trojeburg</i>, <i>Trojenborg</i>, or <i>Tröborg</i>. Another name sometimes
associated with them was <i>Steintanz</i> (Stone Dance).
The Wisby labyrinth is named <i>Tröjeborg</i>.</p>

<div id="ip_151" class="figcenter" style="width: 299px;"><img id="Fig_128" src="images/i_234.jpg" width="299" height="500" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 128.</span>&mdash;Danish Runic Stone Cross, with Labyrinth Figure.
(O. Worm, 1651.)</div></div>

<p>That labyrinths of some kind were also known in olden
Denmark appears from the works of the seventeenth-century
Danish antiquary Olaf Worm, one of whose
woodcuts (<a href="#Fig_128">Fig.&nbsp;128</a>) shows the symbol engraved on an
ancient cross.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
We see then that John Aubrey (see p. 136) was not
altogether speaking at random when he stated his belief
that "we received these Mazes from our Danish ancestors."
In fact, he based his observations on the works of
the Danish and Swedish writers just referred to.</p>

<p>If, as the above considerations lead us to guess, the
use of labyrinthine figures was a common feature of the
northern peoples before the Norse invasion of Britain,
we may wonder whether there is any evidence of the use
of the symbol by earlier inhabitants of the same parts;
are there any indications of this nature to be found among
the relics of prehistoric man in the northern countries?</p>

<p>Well, there are certain remains which have been held
to afford an affirmative reply to this question. The remarkable
prehistoric rock engravings in Northumberland
and the Borders, first noticed about a hundred years
ago and described in detail by Mr. G. Tate in 1864, are
very suggestive in this connection. They include many
figures of a character closely approaching that of a circular
labyrinth, but no actual design of the conventional
Cretan type has been discovered. In <a href="#Fig_129">Figs.&nbsp;129</a> and <a href="#Fig_130">130</a>
are seen examples found on rocks at Routing Linn and
Old Bewick respectively. The engravings are as much
as three or four feet in diameter, and in many cases are
interconnected by grooves which terminate at their cup-like
centres. They often coalesce and interconnect to form
mazy patterns of great complexity. The greater number
consist merely of a series of concentric circles around a
central cup, the circles in some cases being interrupted
along a radial line which is generally occupied by a straight
groove. Their origin and purpose are very obscure.</p>

<p>Very similar rock engravings have been found, though
not in such profusion, in other parts of Great Britain, as
far north as the Orkneys, and as far south as Devonshire,
and also in the south of Ireland. In other parts of Ireland
the engravings have chiefly the shape of a simple spiral.</p>

(G. Tate in Proc. Berwick Naturalists' Club, 1864)</div></div>

<p>There is strong suggestion of the labyrinth idea in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
elaborate series of engravings which adorn the stones of
a cromlech on the island of Gav'r Innis, off the coast of
Brittany. Here the surface of the stones is entirely
covered with engraved concentric grooves, which never
cross one another, but form systems of whorls very much
like those on the skin of human finger-tips. There is,
however, nothing that can be fairly compared with the
designs of the turf mazes, the stone labyrinths or the
coins of Knossos.</p>

<p>Amongst the remarkable assemblage of prehistoric
engravings on the rocky surfaces of the Italian Maritime
Alps is one which exhibits a spiral of five turns, with
interruptions and blind branches, but the resemblance
between this isolated figure and the conventional labyrinth
form is rather too slender to support any useful
deduction as to the ancestry of the latter.</p>

<p>The reader may perhaps wonder whether any traces
of the labyrinths have been found in other continents,
and, if so, whether any connection can be established between
them and the labyrinth cult in Europe. An interesting
discovery in this reference was made some years
ago in the shape of a figure of the Cretan Labyrinth, of
circular type, roughly engraved amid other pictographs
on the wall of the ruined <i>Casa Grande</i>, an old Indian
erection in Pinal County, Arizona, U.S.A.</p>

<p>An exactly similar figure, with the addition of some
unknown symbol opposite its "entrance" (<a href="#Fig_131">Fig.&nbsp;131</a>), was
also found in a manuscript entitled "Rudo Ensayo"
(Rough Essay), written by a Spaniard who visited the
country&mdash;the home of the Pima Indians&mdash;in 1761 or
1762. According to this manuscript the diagram was
scratched in the sand by an Indian and represented the
plan of a building.</p>

<p>Dr. J.&nbsp;W. Fewkes, the Chief of the Bureau of
American Ethnology, who investigated the matter about
fifteen years ago, states that an old Indian living in the
neighbourhood was asked whether he knew of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
building, or remains of one, built on such a plan. He
replied in the negative, but said the figure was commonly
employed in a children's game called <i>Tcuhiki</i>, i.e. the
House of Tcuhu. (Tcuhu is a mythical hero, probably
identical with Gopher, who is supposed to have made the
spiral hole through which the Pima Indians came up
from the underworld.) A writer on this tribe of Indians
has described another game played by them which seems
to have much in common with that mentioned above. It
is called <i>Tculikwikut</i>,
and is played with
rings and darts, count
being kept by means of
little stones which are
moved along a series
of small holes arranged
in the sand in the form
of a whorl, starting
from a centre called

<p>If it could be shown
that these games were
associated with the
labyrinth figure in
those regions before
the date of the Spanish invasion of Mexico we should be
forced to conclude either that, by an extraordinary coincidence,
the figure became evolved independently in the Old
World and the New, or that in both it had a common
origin of astounding antiquity. However, there is a probability
that it was introduced to the Indians by the early
Spaniards, with whom it would have been a familiar
symbol. The only other ancient Indian pictograph of
labyrinthine type so far discovered appears to be that on
a pebble found by Dr. Fewkes in 1919 in a ruin known
as "Square Tower House," in Mesa Verde National<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
Park. This, it will be seen (<a href="#Fig_132">Fig.&nbsp;132</a>), bears no likeness
to the conventional design, but is merely an asymmetrical
meandering groove somewhat similar in appearance to
the braided designs often seen on modish feminine
apparel at the present day. Its significance is unknown.</p>

<p>According to a short review in <i>Folk Lore</i> in 1913, a
book entitled "Some Zulu Customs and Folk Lore,"
by L.&nbsp;H. Samuelson ("Nomleti"), 1912, contained a
description of mazes made on the ground by Zulus.
Unfortunately this book is out of print, and no copy,
strange to say, is to be found in the library of either the
British Museum or the Folk Lore Society. It would be
extremely interesting to know whether the mazes in question
bear any similarity to the traditional Cretan figure.</p>

<p>So far, then, evidence of a definite labyrinth cult is
confined to certain parts of Europe and the Mediterranean
borders. It has, in fact, been shown that it corresponds
roughly with the areas formerly occupied by the
people that built the cromlechs. With regard to its origin
and significance, many interesting speculations have been
made, some of which we will now briefly review.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE DANCE OR GAME OF TROY</span></h2>

<p>Readers of our previous chapters will have noticed the
frequency with which the name "Troy" is associated
with the idea of the labyrinth.</p>

<p>We find this association, for instance, in the case of the
"Troy-towns" of Somerton and Hillbury, the "Walls
of Troy" of the Cumberland Marshes and Appleby
(Lincs), and the "Caerdroia" of the Welsh shepherds.
In northern Europe we find it as "Troja" or in such
combinations as "Trojeborg" or "Tröborg."</p>

<p>That this association is not of recent origin we have
an interesting token in a reference which occurs in a
fifteenth-century French manuscript preserved in the
British Museum. This manuscript is the record of a
journey made by the Seigneur de Caumont to Jerusalem
in 1418, and is entitled "Voyaige d'oultremer en Jhérusalem."
Calling at the island of Crete <i>en route</i>, the
Seigneur, like most other travellers on similar occasions,
takes occasion to make a few remarks about the famous
legend associated with it. He speaks of the "mervelleuse
et orrible best qui fut appellé Minotaur," who, he
says, was confined within "celle entrigade meson faite
par Dedalus, merveilleux maquanit, lequelle meson fut
nommée Labarinte et aujourduy par moultz est vulguelmant
appellé le cipté de Troie."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
It would seem from the latter observation that the
expression "Troy-town" or "City of Troy" was in general
use 500 years ago as a title for the
Cretan Labyrinth, and seeing that
the renaissance of classical learning
was as yet in embryo the inference
is that the name was a popular tradition
of some antiquity.</p>

<p>We find the name of Troy definitely
associated with the labyrinth
long before this, however, in the
crude engravings on the Etruscan
wine-jar which we noticed in
Chapter VIII., the <i>oinochoë</i> from
Tragliatella.</p>

<div id="ip_157" class="figcenter" style="width: 318px;"><img id="Fig_133" src="images/i_242.jpg" width="318" height="500" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 133.</span>&mdash;Etruscan

<p>The meaning of these figures
(<a href="#Fig_133">Figs.&nbsp;133</a>, <a href="#Fig_134">134</a> and <a href="#Fig_134">135</a>) has been
much discussed, but it is now generally
agreed that the labyrinth
shown has a close relationship with the operations which
are being performed by the group of armed men, and it
is obvious that it is also connected in some way with the
famous story of the wars of Troy, as we see by its label
"<i>Truia</i>." What is this operation in which the warriors
are engaged? We find a helpful clue in the story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
related by Virgil (<span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> 70&ndash;19) in his great epic of the
Aeneid, in which the poet has embalmed for us the
legends current in his time concerning the wanderings of
Aeneas, the reputed son of Anchises and Venus, after the
fall of the city of Troy, which he had fought bravely
to defend.</p>

<div id="ip_158" class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img id="Fig_135" src="images/i_243.jpg" width="500" height="196" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 135.</span>&mdash;Etruscan Vase. Details, showing Labyrinth and "retroscript"
label&mdash;"TRUIA." (Deecke.)</div></div>

<p>Aeneas, who escaped from the city carrying his father
on his shoulders, led forth also his little son Iulus. It is this
boy whom, in the fifth book of the poem, Virgil pictures
as taking part with his companions in a sport called the
<i>Ludus Trojae</i> or <i>Lusus Trojae</i> (Game of Troy), sometimes
simply <i>Troja</i>. According to the Roman tradition it was
introduced into Italy by Aeneas, and his son Ascanius
imparted it to the Alban kings and through them to the
Romans. The game consisted of a sort of processional
parade or dance, in which some of the participants
appear to have been mounted on horseback. Virgil draws
a comparison between the complicated movements of
the game and the convolutions of the Cretan Labyrinth:</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>The game is also mentioned as a well-established institution
by other Roman writers of a century or so later,
such as Suetonius and Tacitus, and appears to have
assumed imposing dimensions at one time, as we see from
a representation of it on the reverse of a medal of Nero,
where it has more of the nature of a military review. It
was generally performed by youths, and only those of
good social standing took part.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that we have already had occasion
to notice another ancient dance, or game, in which
youthful notabilities were stated to have taken part, and
in which the motions of the dances were supposed to
represent the tortuous paths of the Cretan Labyrinth,
namely, the dance performed by Theseus and his friends
on the island of Delos. This dance was called the
"Geranos," or Crane Dance, probably on account of
the fancied resemblance of the attitude of the dancers to
that of cranes in flight, or perhaps on account of actual
adornments of the dancers. (An eighteenth-century German
traveller in Russia relates that the Ostiaks of Siberia
had an elaborate Crane Dance, the dancers being dressed
up in the skins of those birds.)</p>

<p>Is there any connection between these two dances, both
labyrinthine in character, the one traditionally based on
the windings of the labyrinth of Knossos, the other compared
by Virgil with the latter, but named after another
city famous in ancient legend&mdash;to wit, Troy?</p>

<p>In regard to both these cities the events celebrated in
the classic legends were of prehistoric occurrence (in so
far as they occurred at all), and their recital was handed
down orally for very many generations before they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
became crystallised in the written record, and it is not
therefore surprising if during that time various versions
were evolved and discrepancies of person, place, and time
were introduced.</p>

<p>The association of the labyrinth, by some of the
Nordic Aryan peoples, with Troy instead of Knossos
may perhaps be accounted for in this way.</p>

<p>The point with which we are most concerned at the
moment, however, is the fact that the figure of the
labyrinth, in each case, is connected with the idea of a
ceremonial game or dance.</p>

<p>Another dance, possibly of similar character, associated
with Knossos, is that mentioned in Homer's
"Iliad" as having been invented by Daedalus for Ariadne.
Youths with golden swords and maidens crowned with
garlands performed it in ranks.</p>

<p>By analogy with a great number of myths, rites, and
ceremonies of ancient and modern races, some anthropologists
have been led to the conclusion that these Troy
and labyrinth dances are only particular expressions of a
very early and widely diffused ceremonial associated with
the awakening of nature in spring, after its winter sleep,
or the release of the imprisoned sun after its long
captivity in the toils of the demon of winter.</p>

<p>In that marvellous compendium of universal folk-lore
"The Golden Bough," and in the particular volume of it
entitled "The Dying God," Sir James Frazer debates the
significance of the classic legends we have mentioned,
and draws the tentative conclusion that Ariadne's dance
was symbolical of the sun's course in the sky, its intention
being, "by sympathetic magic to aid the great luminary
to run his race on high." (See also p. 92.) He draws
attention to a practice observed by Chilcotin Indians,
during eclipses of the sun, of walking around a circle
leaning on staves, as if to help the sun around its course
(much as a child pushes the partition of a railway compartment
to help the train along).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
Mr. A.&nbsp;B. Cook, the Cambridge classical archaeologist,
points out in this connection a Knossian coin on which
the Minotaur, or rather, a man with a bull's mask, is
shown engaged apparently in a similar rite, the reverse
being occupied by a "swastika" labyrinth.</p>

<p>All this appears highly speculative to the ordinary layman,
but nobody who gives a little attention to the subject
can avoid the conclusion that at any rate there must
have existed in very early&mdash;possibly Neolithic&mdash;times
an extremely widespread and important ceremonial,
generally of a sacrificial type, in connection with the
spring awakening. So deeply seated was this ancient
tradition that traces of it have persisted, with various
local modifications, right down to the present day.</p>

<p>The sword-dances and morris-dances of our own
country, most of which but for the happy genius and
industry of Mr. Cecil Sharp and his disciples would
have passed away entirely by the next generation, are
undoubtedly survivals of a ceremonial of this type, particularly
the former. They were performed only on
certain fixed annual occasions, and were treated with
great reverence and meticulous attention to detail.</p>

<p>A correspondent writing to <i>Notes and Queries</i> in
1870 (Anne Silvester) laments the fact that "the old
British game of <i>troy</i>, the vestiges of which are so rare,"
is becoming extinct, but does not describe it. No doubt
the writer had in mind some game played in connection
with earth mazes.</p>

<p>It is a pity that we have no record of the actual method
of "running the maze" in this country in past generations.
The idea that such ingeniously designed and carefully
constructed works were made for the sole purpose
of trotting along their convolutions to the centre and
out again, without any symbolic or religious significance
or any ceremonial observance, may be dismissed at
once.</p>

<p>As regards their alleged use by the Christian Church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
for purposes of penance, we have no reliable evidence,
and even if we had we know that such a use would have
been of a secondary character. Most probably they were
appropriated to some seasonal observance, as in fact we
know that several of them were within quite recent
years, and were associated with some ritual dance similar
in nature to the Crane Dance or the Dance of Troy. With
regard to the word "Troy" itself there is a possibility that
its connection with the dance and the labyrinth figure
may have originated not with the name of a town, but
with some ancient root signifying to wind, or turn; in
the case of the Welsh "Caerdroia," as we have already
seen, this suggestion was made long ago. It may also
have some connection with the three-headed monster
Trojano of the ancient Slavonic mythology, who appears
in the Persian legends as Druja, or Draogha, and in the
Rig-Veda of India as Maho Druho, the Great Druh, and
who plays throughout the same part as the wintry demon
Weyland Smith (or Wieland) of the northern traditions.
In Iceland, as we have already seen (p. <a href="#Page_150">150</a>), the earth
mazes are associated with the latter personage.</p>

<p>We find the word Troi, or Troi-Aldei, applied to
certain ceremonial parades akin to the Troy-dance, in
the writings of Neidhart von Reuenthal, in the early
thirteenth century, the accompanying songs being
termed "Troyerlais."</p>

<p>Quite recently a contributor to "Folk Lore" gave the
airs of three popular dances which are performed by the
Serbians at the present day under the names of Trojanka
and Trojanac. The correspondent in question had
thought that their names might have some connection
with the root <i>tri</i> (= three), with reference to the rhythm
of the dances, but the airs supplied by him certainly
would not support this contention. It is far more probable,
as he seems to conclude, that they indicate a connection
with the Dance of Troy. Unfortunately he does not
describe the dances themselves; it would be interesting to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
know whether they embody any movements suggestive
of a labyrinthine origin or corresponding to the dances
described by Homer and Virgil on the one hand, or to
our morris and sword dances on the other.</p>

<p>Another point in this connection which might justify
a little enquiry is the question of the origin of that
maze-figure which forms, or used to form, part of the
system of Swedish drill as taught to children in this
country.</p>

<p>With regard to our native dances mentioned above,
we may note that every care has been taken by competent
investigators to discover and to preserve as much as
possible of the pure tradition, and we have the satisfaction
of knowing that, narrowly as they escaped oblivion, the
English Folk-Dance Society will see to it that such a
danger will not threaten them again for a very long
time.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE BOWER OF "FAIR ROSAMOND"</span></h2>

<p>The story of "Fair Rosamond" and her mazy Bower,
though it cannot lay claim to that standard of authenticity
which is generally required of historical data, has
for so long occupied an honoured position in the realm
of popular romance that, in a book professing to treat of
mazes from a broad point of view, we cannot dismiss it
quite as briefly as we might perhaps do in a book on
English history.</p>

<p>"Fair Rosamond" has been stated, without very much
foundation, to have been the daughter of Walter de
Clifford, and is in consequence frequently referred to as
Rosamond Clifford.</p>

<p>The story runs that King Henry the Second (<span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 1133
to 1189) adopted her as his mistress, and that, in order
to conceal his illicit amours from his Queen, Eleanor of
Aquitaine, he conducted them within the innermost recesses
of a most complicated maze which he caused to be
made in his park at Woodstock. Rumours of her spouse's
defections having reached the ears of Queen Eleanor,
that indignant lady contrived to penetrate the labyrinth,
confronted her terrified and tearful rival, and forced her
to choose between the dagger and the bowl of poison;
she drained the latter and became forthwith defunct.</p>

<p>Various trimmings, more or less scandalous in nature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
gathered around the central tale, as, for instance, that
Rosamond presented Henry with the son who was afterwards
known as William Longsword, Earl of Salisbury,
but the main outline as indicated above was handed down
intact for many generations.</p>

<p>The poisoning incident is not mentioned in the account
given by a chronicler of that time, John Brompton,
Abbot of Jervaulx (Yorks). It seems to have been
first recorded by a French scribe in the fourteenth
century.</p>

<p>Brompton's version, given under the year 1151 in his
"Chronicon," is as follows:</p>

<p>"Sane idem rex <i>Henricus</i> quanquam multis virtutibus
fuerat ornatus, aliquibus tamen viciis involutus personam
regiam deturpavit. In libidine namque pronus conjugalem
modum excessit. Regina enim sua <i>Elianora</i> jamdudum
incarcerata factus est adulter manifestus, palam
et impudice puellam retinens <i>Rosamundam</i>. Huic nempe
puellae spectatissimae fecerat rex apud <i>Wodestoke</i> mirabilis
architecturae cameram operi <i>Daedalino</i> similem, ne
forsan a regina facile deprehenderetur. Sed illa cito obiit,
et apud <i>Godestowe</i> juxta <i>Oxoniam</i> in capitulo monialium
in tumba decenti est sepulta, ubi talis suprascriptio invenitur:</p>

<p class="p1 center b1">"<i>Hic jacet in tumba Rosa mundi, non Rosa munda;</i><br />
<i>Non redolet, sed olet, quae redolere solet.</i>"</p>

<p>It would appear from this account that the "bower"
was a labyrinth of an architectural kind, perhaps like that
mentioned in Chapter XIV as having been built at
Ardres by Louis of Bourbourg in the previous century,
not, as popularly believed, a maze of evergreens. It will
be seen, also, that Henry did not long enjoy his clandestine
delights, for Rosamond shortly died and was buried
before the high altar of the nunnery church of Godstowe.
Her death is believed to have taken place about 1176.
It is possible that she had entered the nunnery some time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
before that. According to the contemporary annalist
Roger de Hoveden her body was removed in 1191 by
Bishop Hugh of Lincoln, on moral grounds, and was
apparently re-interred in the chapter-house.</p>

<p>The imprisonment of Queen Eleanor, referred to by
Brompton, was a consequence of her connivance at the
rebellion of her sons in 1173&ndash;74.</p>

<p>Ranulph Higden, who lived in the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries, deals with the Henry and Rosamond
story in the seventh book of his "Polychronicon," and
tells us that visitors to Godstowe Abbey used to be shown
a wonderful coffer which had belonged to Rosamond. It
contained figures of birds, beasts, fishes and boxing men,
which, by clockwork or springs, were endowed with
apparently spontaneous motion (Cista ejusdem puella
vix bipedalis mensura, sed mirabilis architectura ibidem
cernitur; in qua conflictus pugilem, gestus animalium,
volatus avium, saltus piscium, absque hominis impulsu
conspiciuntur).</p>

<p>Most of the subsequent chroniclers seem to have
followed Higden in their relation of the story. By Tudor
times the romantic and tragic episode had become a
favourite theme in popular lore; it was enshrined by the
Elizabethan poet Drayton in his "Epistle to Rosamond,"
the bower being therein described as an arrangement of
subterranean vaults. It achieved its greatest popularity,
however, in the ballad form, and was printed, with several
other "Strange Histories or Songs and Sonnets of Kinges,
Princes, Dukes, Lords, Ladyes, Knights and Gentlemen,
etc.," in a black-letter volume written or edited by Thomas
Delone (or Delorney) in 1612. Two editions of the ballad
were represented in the collection of Samuel Pepys, under
the title of "The Life and Death of Rosamond, King
Henry the Second's Concubine. And how she was Poysoned
to Death by Queen Elenor."</p>

<p>John Aubrey, in his "Remaines," 1686, tells us that
his nurse used to sing the following verses to him:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">Her name was called so,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To whom dame Elinor our Queene<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Was known a deadly foe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The King therefore for her defence<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Against the furious Queene<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Woodstocke builded such a Bower<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The like was never seen.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Most curiously that Bower was built<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of stone and timber strong.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An hundered and fifty dores<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Did to this Bower belong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they so cunningly contriv'd<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With turnings round about<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That none but with a clew of thread<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Could enter in or out."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">The whole ballad will be found in the well-known
"Reliques of Ancient English Poetry," collected by
Bishop Percy and published by him in 1765.</p>

<p>Of a widely different nature was the version published
in 1729 by Samuel Croxall in his "Select Collection of
Novels," Vol. IV. "The Loves of King Henry II and
Fair Rosamond." Here the attitude assumed is one of
learned contempt for popular credulity. "What have we
in this Story," says Croxall, "but a Copy of Ariadne's
Clue and the Cretan Labyrinth?... Yet are we not to
wonder that the monkish Historians should deliver down
to us a Tale of such Absurdity, when the same Chronicles
tell us that, in that King's Reign, a Dragon of marvellous
Bigness was seen at St. Osyth's in Essex, which, by its
very motion, set many Houses and Buildings on Fire."</p>

<p>As for the inscription on Rosamond's tomb, quoted
by Brompton, our critic is equally scornful. "The conceit,"
he says, "is poor and common and, like the other
Poetry of those times, depends on a certain Jingle and
Play on the Words. The sense of them has been thus
expressed in honest English Metre:"</p>

<p>(Whether the verse is in better taste when expressed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
honest English metre the reader must judge for himself.)</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Rose of the World, not Rose the peerless Flow'r,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within this Tomb hath taken up her Bow'r.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She scenteth now, and nothing Sweet doth smell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who earst was wont to savour passing well."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">This rendering is perhaps preferable to that of Stowe
("Annals," 1631), which concludes with:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Though she were sweete, now foully doth she stinke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mirrour good for all men, that on her thinke."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>In any case the epitaph must be accounted a libel in
one respect, for Leland, the Antiquary to Henry VIII,
records that, on the opening of Rosamond's tomb, at the
dissolution of Godstowe nunnery, the bones were found
to be encased in leather, surrounded by lead, and that "a
very swete smell came out of it."</p>

<p>An interesting point mentioned by Croxall is that in
his time "a delightful Bower" was still in existence at
Woodstock and was shown as the original of the story.
Another reliable writer of the same period (Thomas
Hearne, 1718) makes a similar observation, but in this
case it is made clear that the remains are those of a large
building, not, as we might have inferred, those of a hedge
maze or arbour. These remains, whatever they may have
been, have disappeared long since.</p>

<p>Woodstock Park, according to the historian Rouse of
Warwick, was the first park to be made in England.
Henry the First had a palace here, but the present great
building, the masterpiece of Sir John Vanbrugh, was
built for the first Duke of Marlborough and was named
after the scene of his famous victory, Blenheim.</p>

<p>The traditional story of Fair Rosamond, in which she
is made to figure as a cruelly wronged and guileless
damsel of impregnable virtue and the victim of an unreasoning
jealousy, formed the basis of many novels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
<i>e.g.</i>, "Fair Rosamond," by T. Miller ("The Parlour
Library"), 1847, and as late as 1911 it was cast into the
form of a one-act tragedy by Mr. Oliver W.&nbsp;F. Lodge,
under the name of "The Labyrinth," and was first performed
by the Pilgrim Players on October 14 in that
year. A little-known opera by Addison deals with the
same theme; it is entitled "Rosamond" and is inscribed
to the Duchess of Marlborough. The most poignant
and beautiful version of the tragedy is that given by
Swinburne in his "Rosamond" (not, of course, to be
confused with his "Rosamund").</p>

<p>Tennyson, in his "Becket," makes that prelate rescue
Rosamond from the Queen at the crucial moment and
take her to Godstowe nunnery, whence she later escapes
to intercede&mdash;ineffectually&mdash;with his murderers in

<p>No authentic portrait of Rosamond is known to exist,
but in Hampton Court Palace, just outside Cardinal
Wolsey's Room, there hangs a half-length female portrait
by an unknown painter (No. 961 [937]), which is
labelled Rosamond Clifford. The lady depicted, however,
is attired in a fashion which did not obtain until considerably
later than the time of Rosamond; in fact, there
seems to be no justification whatever for assuming that
the picture represents the fair Rosamond at all, except
perhaps in the imagination of the artist.</p>

<span class="subhead">MAZE ETYMOLOGY</span></h2>

<p>The reader may be inclined to question the necessity for
a whole chapter to be devoted to such a matter as this.
"Surely anybody who has the curiosity to do so can look
the words up in a dictionary!" Or he may object that the
proper place to define and expound one's terms is in the
opening chapter.</p>

<p>It will be found, however, that no clear-cut and simple
definition of, for example, the word <i>labyrinth</i> itself is to
be found in any dictionary, and that with regard to its
derivation authorities are not even yet in complete agreement.
With the facts recounted in the preceding chapters
at his disposal the reader may possibly find a little informal
discussion of these points more intelligible and
interesting than the more rigid presentment afforded by
even the best dictionaries. Moreover, most dictionaries
have little or nothing to say about Julian's bowers or Troy-towns.
On the other hand, of course, this chapter could
not have been written without free recourse to Murray,
Skeat, Webster, Wright, and other monuments of the
lexicographer's toil.</p>

<p>We will consider such words as seem worth discussing
in their alphabetical order, commencing with one
which was prominent in our last chapter, viz., "bower."</p>

<p>We have here a word of which the early connotation
has been rather obscured by poetical insistence upon one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
of its extensions. As a convenient rhyme for "flower"
and "shower" it has become one of the mainstays of the
vernal poetaster, a circumstance which evoked one of the
gems of Calverley's gentle satire:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Bowers of flowers encountered showers<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In William's carol&mdash;(O love my Willie!);<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he bade sorrow borrow from blithe tomorrow<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I quite forget what&mdash;say a daffodilly."<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="attrib">(<i>Lovers, and a Reflection.</i>)
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The word has thus come to be chiefly employed to
signify a leafy or shady arbour or a recess in a garden, a
use quite consistent with, but narrower than, the principal
and much older meaning, which was that of a dwelling,
with particular reference to the character of privacy.</p>

<p>The common modern usage seems to have been first
adopted by the Elizabethan poets. Hero, in "Much Ado
about Nothing" (Act III, Sc. 1), sends by her attendant
a message to her cousin Beatrice, bidding her</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"... steal into the pleached bower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where honeysuckles, ripened by the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forbid the sun to enter."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The Saxon form of the word was <i>búr</i> or <i>bure</i>, related to
<i>búan</i>, meaning "to dwell," and it was always used to
denote something of the nature of an inner chamber or
sanctum.</p>

<p>In Chaucer's works (late fourteenth century) it has
the same force, <i>e.g.</i>, in the "Wife of Bath's Tale":</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Blissing halles, chambres, kitchines and boures."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Somewhat later we find a poetical extension of the
word to include not only the dwellings of human beings
but also of animals and birds. Thus William Dunbar, a
Scottish poet who lived about 1465&ndash;1530, speaking of
birds hidden within thickets, used the phrase "within
their bouris." This usage gave rise to the idea that the
word was derived from "bough," a notion that seems to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
have first found expression in the anonymous "Letters
of Junius," and shortly afterwards received the weighty
sanction of Dr. Johnson. In Southey's "Curse of
Kehama" the word in this sense is made to do duty
as a verb:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"And through the leafy cope which bowered it o'er<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came gleams of chequered light."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The metaphorical use of the word in its original sense
is seen in Moore's "Evenings in Greece":</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Fancy, who hath no present home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But builds her bower in scenes to come."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The suggestion that Rosamond's Bower was of the
nature of a hedge maze seems to be of rather late origin,
probably arising in the seventeenth century, like the
application of the term to the little hedge-box garden at
Menteith (Queen Mary's Bower), to which we referred
in Chapter XIII. In the earlier writers it is almost invariably
spoken of as a building. Robert Fabyan, for instance,
a historian of the late sixteenth century, speaks of it as a
"house named Labyrinthus or Daedalus worke, or howse
wroughte like unto a knot in a garden called a maze," and
in some anonymous verses of the mid-fifteenth century
it is stated:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Att Wodestocke for hure he made a toure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That is called Rosemoundes boure."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>It would appear that the Bower which is commemorated
in the place-name of Havering-at-Bower, Essex,
was also of the nature of a building, probably of large
dimensions, for, according to an "Appendix on Bowers"
annexed to an "Essay on Design in Gardening," by
George Mason, 1795, there was a long-standing tradition
to the effect that it was the site of a king's residence,
and an old man of the locality could remember "many
chimnies of the old bower standing." This may or may
not be evidence, but it is at all events quite in keeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
with the ancient use of the word. The royal residence in
question would no doubt have been of the nature of a
private retreat, not a court.</p>

<p>Writing in 1827, the Rev. H.&nbsp;J. Todd says, "In Cumberland,
to this day, a back room or parlour is called a
<i>boor</i>."</p>

<p>It will be seen from the remark of John Aubrey quoted
on page <a href="#Page_136">136</a> that he assumed "borough" to be identical in
origin with "bower." The former is, however, derived
from the Anglo-Saxon <i>burg</i> or <i>burh</i>, a city, allied to
<i>beorgan</i>, to protect.</p>

<p>In any large dictionary there will be found detailed
several other meanings for the word "bower"&mdash;including
the sense in which it is used in Bret Harte's "Heathen
Chinee"&mdash;but with these we are not here concerned.</p>

<p>Strange to say, the use of the word in the combination
"Julian-bower" or "Julian's-bower" is usually overlooked
or ignored.</p>

<p>The English Dialect Dictionary (Wright) gives the
local variants <i>Gelyan-bower</i>, <i>Gillimber</i> and <i>Jilling-bo'or</i> as
occurring in Lincolnshire, and <i>Jul-laber</i> as another form
of the "Julaber's Barrow" or "Juliberry's Grave" which
we have already noticed in Kent. Is the "bower" here
the same as "barrow," which is derived from the Anglo-Saxon
<i>beorg</i>, meaning, like the German <i>berg</i>, a hill? Or
is it only the same word that we have met with in "Rosamond's
Bower"? The former suggestion receives some
support from the fact that turf mazes are often, though
not always, constructed on the top of a hill or mound, but
to the writer there is something more attractive in conceiving
these works to be associated with the idea of a
retreat, particularly if we consider, as we have some
reason for doing, that the Julian referred to is the benign
and hospitable Saint Julian of the mediaeval legends.</p>

<p>From Brand's "Popular Antiquities" it appears that
there were three or four saints of this name, but the most
well-known of these was the knight whose deeds are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
celebrated in the "Gesta Romanorum" and elsewhere,
the reputed patron and protector of pilgrims and travellers.
The chapel of Domus Dei at Southampton, now
used as the French Protestant church, is dedicated to
this St. Julian. The legend goes, that on returning home
one day Julian discovered a man and woman asleep in
his bed, jumped to the hasty conclusion that his wife had
been untrue to him and slew the pair where they lay, only
to find that they were his parents who had travelled from
afar to visit him. In repentance and atonement he then
founded a hospice for travellers and afterwards became
known as <i>Hospitator</i>, or "the gude herbejour," in which
capacity his renown is testified by many a reference in
our early literature, <i>e.g.</i>, in the works of Chaucer:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Now up the heed; for al is wel;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seynt Julyan, lo, bon hostel!<br /></span>

<div class="poem-container">

<span class="i0">Seint Julian he was in his contré."<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="attrib">(<i>Canterbury Tales</i>.)
</div></div>
</div>

<p>It seems to the writer just as likely that the name
Julian's-bower commemorates this popular hero as that
it has any connection, as some have maintained, with the
invading Caesar or, as suggested by others (see Chapter
XI), with his tribune, Quintus Laberius Durus. One can
quite easily conjure up in imagination a game or ceremony
in which the fatigues of the pilgrim treading the
long course of the labyrinth's folds is rewarded by some
form of refreshment on at length reaching the secluded
retreat of the hospitable saint.</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>When we turn from our native bowers to the Aegean
<i>labyrinthos</i>, transmitted practically intact from the ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
Greek to most modern European languages, we are venturing
on dangerous ground indeed, for the derivation
of this word has been the subject of much disputation
between rival schools of etymologists and philologists
in recent years.</p>

<p>Down to a few decades ago we were content with the
bald statement of most dictionaries that it was probably
correlated with the word <i>laura</i>, meaning a passage, or
<span class="locked">mine,<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></span> though there was also a suggestion that it might
be of Egyptian origin, viz., that it was derived from the
name of Labaris (= Senusret III), erroneously conceived
by the scribe Manetho to be the founder of the Hawara
pile. Then Mr. Max Mayer put forward the suggestion
that it might have some connection with <i>labrys</i>, a word
which, in some of the early languages of Asia Minor, <i>e.g.</i>,
Lydia and Caria, denoted an axe, the axe being the
symbol associated with the god known as Zeus Labrandeus
or Zeus Stratios, the worship of whom was known
to have taken place at Labranda, in Caria. Coins from
Mylasa, a neighbouring town, show this god holding in
his hand a double axe.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5" id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> "Coil-of-rope walk" according to Ruskin (<i>Fors Clav.</i>).</p></div>

<p>The stir created by the discovery of double axes in
abundance, with every indication of their religious and
symbolic use, during the course of Sir Arthur Evans's
explorations in the traditional home of the Cretan labyrinth,
can therefore be well understood. As a consequence
thereof every self-respecting dictionary nowadays gives
pre-eminence to the <i>labrys</i> derivation of "labyrinth." At
the same time it is well to bear in mind that many learned
scholars have seen great difficulty in accepting this theory,
mainly on account of the metathesis, or change-over, of
the <i>r</i> and the <i>y</i> (<i>u</i> in Greek), which was stated to be unexampled,
and to the addition of the termination <i>-inthos</i>.
With regard to the latter it now seems to be generally
agreed among scholars that this termination occurs only
in words which were assimilated from the pre-existing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
peoples of the Aegean lands, whom the Greeks, as
northern invading hordes, overcame and superseded.
The suffix is preserved only, however, in extremely few
common nouns (<i>terebinthos</i> = the turpentine tree, <i>asaminthos</i>
= a bathing-place), and in a similarly small number
of place-names, such as <i>Tirynthos</i> (Tiryns) and <i>Corinthos</i>
(Corinth). It is the equivalent of the ending <i>-nda</i> in
certain place-names in Asia Minor, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Labranda</i>.</p>

<p>The conjectures that the word was connected with
<i>labros</i>, meaning "great," or that it was derived from the
old Egyptian <i>la-pe-ro-hunt</i>, "the temple at the mouth of
the reservoir," are hardly worth repeating.</p>

<p>The present position, then, is that the Labyrinth is
the House of the Double Axe, the implication being that
the Cretan example was not, as formerly believed, a
miniature reproduction of the temple of Hawara, but that
the latter was actually given the title by analogy with the
building at Knossos.</p>

<p>As regards the use of the word in our own language,
it was probably well known to most of the churchmen of
the early and middle ages, through the medium of the
classic authors accessible to them, but it never passed
into common speech. In Chaucer's works, <i>i.e.</i>, in the
fourteenth century, we find both <i>maze</i> and <i>labyrinth</i> employed;
but whereas the latter evidently refers to the
Cretan tradition, the English word seems to denote some
figure familiar to the poet's readers&mdash;perhaps, we may
conjecture, in the form of turf mazes.</p>

<p>Thus, in "The Hous of Fame" (line 826, etc.), he says:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Tho gan I forth with him to goon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the castel, soth to saye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tho saugh I stoude in a valeye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the castel, faste by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An hous, that <i>domus Dedali</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That <i>Laborintus</i> cleped is,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nas maed so wonderliche, y-wis<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ne half so queynteliche y-wrought";<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>
<p class="in0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
and in his "Legend of Ariadne," one of his minor poems,
we read (line 125, etc.):</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"This wepen shal the gayler, on that tyde,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ful privily within the prison hyde;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, for the hous is krinkeled to and fro,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hath so queinte weyes for to go&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For hit is shapen as the <i>mase</i> is wroght&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thereto have I a remedie in my thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, by a clewe of twyne, as he hath goon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The same way he may returne anoon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Folwing alway the thread, as he hath come."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Seeing that the "hous" here referred to is the Cretan
labyrinth itself, the "mase" with which it is compared
must be something sufficiently familiar to Chaucer's
audience to furnish them with a ready illustration of the
nature of the legendary structure which he is describing
and which elsewhere he calls The Labyrinth or the House
of Daedalus.</p>

<p>From very early times the classic authors used the
word "labyrinth" metaphorically, and the mediaeval
writers followed them. For instance Walter, a canon of
St. Victor, towards the end of the twelfth century wrote
a work which he called "A Treatise Against the Four
Labyrinths of France," in reference to the great theological
work in four books, known as the "Book of
Sentences," a long and very metaphysical compendium
of divinity, by Peter, Bishop of Paris.</p>

<p>In Renaissance times we find the word commonly used
as a simile for the difficulties of life or the vagaries of love.</p>

<p>In Shakespeare's "King Henry VI" (Pt. I, V, Sc. 3)
the Earl of Suffolk, after the exit of the gentle Margaret
of Anjou, whose hand he has been soliciting on behalf of
his royal master, exclaims:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"O, wert thou for myself!&mdash;But, Suffolk, stay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou mayst not wander in that labyrinth:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There Minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
We will notice further examples of this use of the word
a little later, in connection with book-titles.</p>

<p>In "Troilus and Cressida" (Act II, Sc. 3) Thersites
bursts into soliloquy before the tent of Achilles with:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"How now, Thersites! What, lost in the labyrinth of thy fury!"<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Milton says that "Lethe, the river of oblivion, rolls her
watery labyrinth," and Pope that "Love in these labyrinths
his slaves detains"; but the occurrence of such expressions
in writings of all periods is too common to need
further quotation. We might perhaps point out that a
slight shade of difference may be assumed to exist between
"labyrinth" and "maze," even when these words
are used in their metaphorical sense. We may take "labyrinth"
to signify a complex problem involving merely
time and perseverance for its solution, "maze," on the
other hand, being reserved for situations fraught, in
addition, with the elements of uncertainty and ambiguity,
calling for the exercise of the higher mental faculties&mdash;in
short, we may regard the two words as having reference
respectively to the unicursal and multicursal types of
plan (<i>see</i> Introduction). A distinction of this kind adds
point to a sentence like that which occurs, for instance,
in Mr. Lytton Strachey's "Queen Victoria," where he
tells us (p. 178) that the Prince Consort "attempted to
thread his way through the complicated labyrinth of
European diplomacy, and was eventually lost in the
maze."</p>

<p>As a means of expressing complexities of outline or of
inner structure, natural or artificial, the word has been
adopted by various branches of science or art. Every
student of anatomy knows the "labyrinth" of the inner
ear, every geological tyro has heard of those gigantic
amphibians of Carboniferous to Triassic times whose
peculiarly lamellated teeth have earned for them the title
of "labyrinthodonts." Zoologists are acquainted with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
those lowly protoplasmic forms of life which, on account
of the mazy net-like appearance assumed at one stage in
their life-history, are called "labyrinthulidea." Even the
engineer finds it convenient to make use of the word, as,
for instance, when he speaks of a "labyrinth-packing"
for turbines, an arrangement which allows a certain
amount of lateral motion while ensuring steam-tightness.</p>

<p>We may remark in passing that the names of the
artificer Daedalus and of the winding river Meander
have also done duty in scientific nomenclature in some
cases where it was desired to commemorate labyrinthine
characteristics; for example, a pretty little fungus allied
to the <i>Stereum</i> so common on decaying wood has received
the generic title of <i>Daedalea</i>, on account of the mazy
pattern displayed by its spore-bearing surface, while the
beautiful "brain-stone" coral is known to the naturalist
under the name of <i>Meandrina</i>.</p>

<p>Compound words formed with "maze," on the other
hand, are usually of an old-fashioned or local character,
such as "Maze-Sunday," which in Devonshire dialect
signifies a Sunday given up to feasting; such compounds
are rarely formed for scientific or technical purposes.
The sheet glass which is obscured by a system of wrinkles
on its surface is, however, sometimes known as "maze-glass."</p>

<p>The word <i>maze</i> is probably of Scandinavian origin.
Its oldest significance seems to be that of a state of bewilderment
or confusion, or of being wrapped in thought&mdash;a
use which we nowadays regard as metaphorical. In
the Swedish and Norwegian languages are related words
which mean on the one hand to dream, or lounge, or to
move about in an idle or lazy manner, and on the other
hand to chatter or indulge in aimless talk.</p>

<p>Some dictionaries formerly stated that it was derived
from an Anglo-Saxon word <i>mase</i>, meaning "a whirlpool,"
but it has been shown that there was no such word.</p>

<p>In various dialects it is still used in its original sense.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
One may often hear from the older type of country folk
such expressions as "It fair mazed me to see it," giving
one the feeling that the syllable "a-" has been dropped,
whereas it was never there. In Shakespeare the expression
frequently occurs. Titania, in "Midsummer Night's
Dream" (Act II, Sc. 2), says:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"... the spring, the summer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The childing autumn, angry winter, change<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their wonted liveries; and the maz'd world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By their increase, now knows not which is which."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Talbot of Shrewsbury, in his dire straits before the walls
of Bordeaux ("King Henry VI," Pt. I, Act IV, Sc. 2),
exclaims:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"O, negligent and heedless discipline!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How are we park'd and bounded in a pale,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little herd of England's timorous deer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Maz'd with a yelping kennel of French curs!"<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">(See also "King Henry VIII," Act II, Sc. 4, line 185.)</p>

<p>That the word as here quoted has no identity with the
word "amazed" is clear from a comparison of its context
with that of the latter in the numerous instances of
its employment by Shakespeare. The verb "to maze" is
found in Chaucer:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"'Ye maze, maze, gode sire,' quod she,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'This thank have I for I have maad yow see.'"<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="attrib">(<i>The Marchantes Tale</i>, l. 2387.)
</div></div>
</div>

<p>In the sense of crazy, wild, or thoughtless, we find it in
the dialect expressions "Mazed-antic" and "Mazegerry."</p>

<p>As a metaphor it is employed in like manner to its
Greek equivalent. In "The Taming of the Shrew"
Petruchio declares: "I have thrust myself into this
maze, Haply to wive and thrive as best I may." "Let
us," says Pope, in the "Essay on Man,"</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Expatiate free o'er all this scene of man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mighty maze! but not without a plan."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
The term has no connection with the word which
we see in, for instance, Mr. Hall Caine's novel "The
Deemster":</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Nine maze&mdash;not bad for the first night."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">This is a variant of the word <i>mease</i> and denotes a
measure of 500 herrings!</p>

<p>Of the etymology of the term "Troy-town" some
indications have already been given in Chapter XVIII.
We might, perhaps, in addition, hazard the guess that
the Sanskrit root <i>dru</i> (= run) has some bearing on the
origin of the word so widely associated with the idea of
a dance or ceremonial, but the connection is too obscure
to be very helpful.</p>

<p>We might further recall the ancient <span class="locked">legend,<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></span> recorded
in Welsh chronicles going back many centuries before
the Christian era, to the effect that a great-grandson of
Aeneas named Prydain, or Brutus, came over to this
country with the Trojan prisoners of war whom he had
helped to liberate from Greece, and with their aid built
a city on the banks of the Temus (Thames), which he
called <i>Caerdroi-Newydd</i> (New City of Troy). This name
became corrupted into <i>Troinovant</i>&mdash;hence the "Trinobantes"
of Caesar's time&mdash;and was later discarded in
favour of <i>Caerludd</i>, a name given in honour of Lludd,
nephew of the Caswallon who fought against Caesar. The
Saxons afterwards corrupted the name into <i>Lun-dun</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6" id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> Accepted as a historic fact by Mr. E.&nbsp;O. Gordon in his

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"For noble Britons sprang from Trojans bold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Troy-Novant was built of old Troyes ashes cold."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>If any reliance could be placed on this old story the
Corporation of London might do well to embody the
Labyrinth, or Troy-town, in their armorial bearings, for
what symbol could better typify the complexities of our

<span class="subhead">LABYRINTH DESIGN AND SOLUTION OF MAZES</span></h2>

<p>There is no limit to the number of patterns which, without
any metaphorical extension of terms, we may legitimately
describe as coming within the scope of the words
"maze" and "labyrinth." In common speech we use
either word to describe any artificial design or natural
pattern presenting a convoluted appearance, or any
path or channel of an intricate nature, but when we come
to consider the matter more carefully we feel the need for
some definition. As we have seen, the dictionaries do not
help us much in this respect. Let us, therefore, decide
what limitations we feel compelled to observe in our use
of the terms from the point of view of designers or
unravellers of mazes and labyrinths.</p>

<p>In the first place we must limit ourselves to works of
artifice, <i>i.e.</i>, we must exclude the "labyrinths" of nature,
such as forests, caverns, and so forth, and agree that any
application of our terms to such objects is to be regarded
as strictly metaphorical.</p>

<p>Secondly, we must require, as a practical corollary to
our first condition, that there shall be an element of purposefulness
in the design. The purpose may be the portrayal
of the imagined course of the sun through the
heavens, the symbolisation of the folds of sin or of the
Christian's toilsome journey through life, the construction
of a puzzle, or the mere pleasure to be derived from packing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
the maximum of path into the minimum of space,
but there must be an object of some sort. The aimless
scribblings of an infant, like the trail of an ink-dipped fly,
may in this connection be considered as the fortuitous
meanderings of nature rather than the conscious design
of man. By imposing this condition we exclude the
Indian pictograph shown in <a href="#Fig_132">Fig.&nbsp;132</a>, which, in the
absence of any indication as to its significance, can only
by a loose extension of the term be called a labyrinth.</p>

<p>(Our use of the words "aim," "design," and "purpose"
will be quite clear to everybody but the sciolist
dabbling in metaphysics.)</p>

<p>Thirdly, there must be a certain degree of complexity
in the design, a degree which it is manifestly impossible
to define as it must be considered in conjunction with
other characteristics in any particular case. In the case of
a unicursal labyrinth, <i>i.e.</i>, one in which there is only one
path, the complexity lies in the multiplicity of turnings
and the extent of the departure from pure geometrical
figures such as the meander, the zigzag, and the spiral;
in the case of a puzzle-figure it lies partly in this but
partly also in the number and disposition of branch-paths.
It naturally follows that in a unicursal design there
cannot be absolute symmetry, although, with a little
ingenuity, a very pleasing <i>appearance</i> of symmetry may
be obtained.</p>

<p>Fourthly, there must be communication between the
component parts of the design; in other words, the path
must be continuous. This does not preclude the occurrence
in the design of closed "islands," but only makes it
clear that such inclusions do not form part of the labyrinth
proper.</p>

<p>Fifthly, there must be communication between the
interior and the exterior. We might not altogether withhold
the application of the term "labyrinth" or "maze"
in the case of a closed design, but we should have to
qualify it, <i>e.g.</i>, by prefixing the word "closed." In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
case of the beautiful and intricate mosaic pavement
found in the <i>Casa del Labirinto</i> at Pompeii mentioned on
page 46, for example, although we know that the pattern
was intended to convey an allusion to the Cretan labyrinth,
we cannot look upon it as a true labyrinth design;
not only is there no communication with the exterior, but
by its repetition of purely geometrical design it fails to
satisfy our third condition.</p>

<p>If the reader chooses to formulate for himself a working
definition based on the above remarks he is at liberty
to do so, but he may take for granted that nobody else
will accept it. However, he will have gained, at any rate,
a clearer conception of the matter than he would perhaps
have gathered from any dictionary.</p>

<p>We have seen that mazes and labyrinths may be
roughly divided into two types as regards the principle of
their design, namely, into <i>unicursal</i> and <i>multicursal</i> types,
or, as some say, into "non-puzzle" and "puzzle" types
respectively. The word "unicursal" has hitherto been
chiefly used by mathematicians to describe a class of problems
dealing with the investigation of the shortest route
between two given points or of the method of tracing
a route between two points in a given figure without
covering any part of the ground more or less than once
(<i>e.g.</i>, the well-known "bridge" problems), but there is no
reason why we should not apply the adjective "unicursal"
(= "single course" or "once run") to denote those figures
which consist of a single unbranched path, using the
term "multicursal" as its complement, or antonym. We
must not draw too hard a line between these two types;
for instance, we could not reasonably insist that the turf
maze at Wing (<a href="#Fig_60">Fig.&nbsp;60</a>) is multicursal simply on account
of the dichotomy of its path to form the central loop.
Where the loop is itself relatively large and complex, as
in the Poitiers example (<a href="#Fig_55">Fig.&nbsp;55</a>), there are better grounds
for doing so, but it is plain that in such cases the point is
one to be decided by common-sense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
Let us consider a little further the various <i>forms</i> of
labyrinth design and make some sort of a classification.</p>

<p>In the first place we may observe that a labyrinth
(using this word, for convenience, as embracing "maze")
may be arranged in one plane, as we commonly see it on
a sheet of paper, or it may be disposed in two or more
intercommunicating planes, like the Egyptian labyrinth
or a block of flats. We may thus classify all
labyrinths, for a start, as either two-dimensional or three-dimensional.
As the vast majority belong to the first
class and as, moreover, every subdivision of the first
class may be applied equally to the second, we need say
no more concerning the latter except to remark that the
complexity of a garden maze may be greatly increased,
if desired, by introducing tunnels or bridges, thus converting
it into a three-dimensional maze.</p>

<p>Another general grouping of labyrinths would be into
"compact" and "diffuse" types, the former having, in a
typical case, the whole of its area occupied by the convolutions
of its path and its bounding walls, the latter
having spaces between the bounding walls of the various
sections of the path, such spaces having no communication
with the path itself. Amongst unicursal labyrinths
the Alkborough specimen (<a href="#Fig_59">Fig.&nbsp;59</a>) exemplifies the
compact type and the Pimperne maze (<a href="#Fig_63">Fig.&nbsp;63</a>) the
diffuse type.</p>

<p>The Hampton Court maze (<a href="#Fig_111">Fig.&nbsp;111</a>) may serve as
the type of a compact and the Versailles example (<a href="#Fig_88">Fig.&nbsp;88</a>)
that of a diffuse multicursal labyrinth.</p>

<p>With regard to the nature of the path itself, we may
distinguish broadly between labyrinths with curved and
those with straight paths, allowing for an intermediate
"mixed" group in which part of the path is curved and
part straight. Examples of each kind will be found
amongst the figures given.</p>

<p>Multicursal mazes, again, may be subdivided according
to the manner of branching of the path, <i>e.g.</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
according to whether the branches are simple or subdivided
(the occurrence of more than one branch at
any point may be considered as the case of a subdivided
branch), whether the branches do or do not rejoin the
main path, forming "loops," and whether&mdash;a rather important
point as regards the solution of the maze&mdash;the
"goal" is or is not situated within a loop.</p>

<p>Finally we may create separate classes for those mazes
in which there are two or more equivalent routes between
the entrance and the goal, those which have two or more
entrances, and those in which there is no distinct goal
(<i>e.g.</i>, the Versailles maze) or in which there are two or
more equivalent goals.</p>

<p>We can represent the branch system of any labyrinth
whatever in a very simple manner by means of a straight-line
diagram, wherein the paths of the labyrinth are
represented by lines, to scale if need be, branches being
shown to the left or right respectively of the main straight
line representing the shortest path from the entrance to
the goal. It will be seen that no account is taken of the
actual orientation or of changes of direction of any part
of the path.</p>

<p>A unicursal labyrinth will thus be represented by a
single straight line. <a href="#Fig_136">Figs.&nbsp;136</a> and <a href="#Fig_137">137</a> represent, roughly
to scale, the Hampton Court and Hatfield mazes respectively
and should be compared with those shown in
<a href="#Fig_111">Figs.&nbsp;111</a> and <a href="#Fig_87">87</a>. Triangles and discs may be used, as
shown, to indicate entrances and goals respectively.</p>

<p>Such diagrams as these are just as useful as the actual
plans of the mazes for the purpose of serving as a clue for
the visitor; in fact, they are really more easily followed.</p>

<p>Amongst the many speculations that have from time
to time been made regarding the origin and significance
of the design on the Knossian coins, the suggestion was
made by a contributor to <i>Knowledge</i> about thirty years
ago&mdash;somewhat similar theories having been expounded
by a German writer a decade earlier&mdash;that this figure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
was a simplified diagram comparable with the diagrams
described above. According to this conception the
figure was intended as a clue to the actual labyrinth, the
designs on the coins being perhaps copied from those on
"souvenir" tokens issued by the priests or curators of the
edifice, and indicated the right path to be taken, all other
paths being omitted. By splitting the circular dividing
walls so as to form a passage of the same width as the path
shown in the figure, a maze of much more intricate
appearance was arrived at, which, it was thought, might
bear some resemblance to the form of the original
labyrinth.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Dr. E. Krause, in a book of about
the same date, showed how the Knossian design and
certain other unicursal figures might be derived from a
series of concentric circles, with interruptions along a
radial line like the figures in the northern rock engravings
described in Chapter XVII, by means of one or two
simple methods of cross-connection (<a href="#Fig_138">Figs. 138 and 139</a>).</p>

<p>Such speculations give food for thought, but we must
remember that so far they <i>are</i> speculations and not
statements of fact.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
The use of the straight-line diagrams suggested above
may be found helpful not only as a means of facilitating
the study of an existing labyrinth, but also to some
extent in designing a new one. It is not necessary to
describe here in detail how to design a maze:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"It is purely a matter of skill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which all may attain if they will,"<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">and, like most tasks requiring simply common-sense,
patience, and practice, it is much more trouble to explain
than to perform. As regards the design of hedge mazes,
the fact that the circumstances are hardly ever alike in
any two actual cases gives plenty of scope for individuality
and ingenuity. The space allowed may be strictly limited,
or it may be of an awkward shape. The materials available
for the walls may vary widely in character according
to the space they require for their proper growth and
maintenance, and thus affect the amount of path-area.</p>

<div id="ip_188" class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img id="Fig_138" src="images/i_273.jpg" width="500" height="264" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 138 and 139.&mdash;Derivation of Labyrinth Types from Rock-engraving
Figures. (After Krause.)</div></div>

<p>There are one or two points which are of general application
and should be borne in mind. For instance, if the
object of the designer is to provide a maze which shall
offer a fair amount of puzzledom without imposing undue
fatigue on the visitor, he must take care that the nearest
route from the centre to the exterior be neither too long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
nor too short. If the space to be covered by the maze is
large the tendency to over-elaboration of the design must
be avoided.</p>

<p>Another feature which is likely to spoil an otherwise
good design is the inclusion of long stretches of path
without bend or branching; these are tedious and annoying,
especially when they have to be retraced by reason
of their leading into a <i>cul-de-sac</i>.</p>

<p>In a large maze it is well to relieve monotony by means
of occasional variations in the mode of treatment of the
hedge, the introduction of arbours, statues, etc.; but
these should not be of such a character as to defeat one
of the main objects of the design by providing easy clues.</p>

<p>If the maze is intended to be seen at all from above,
some attempt should be made to introduce a symmetrical
and artistic element into its design. Usually some
vantage-point is available from which an attendant or
expert can observe and direct over-bewildered visitors,
but if this point be accessible to the visitors themselves
the hedges should be provided with pinnacles or balks,
here and there, to prevent the observer from solving the
puzzle by unfair means. This is the case with, for instance,
the Saffron Walden maze; at Hampton Court,
where there are no balks, only the attendant is permitted
to mount the rostrum.</p>

<p>The "solution" of mazes means the discovery of a
route to their "goal." (This word is preferable to
"centre," as the object of quest is not necessarily at the
geometrical centre of the maze, but may be considerably
removed from it.)</p>

<p>It would be going too far to say the <i>shortest</i> route,
as this would be discoverable only from the plan or by
prolonged experience, but the goal in any maze will on
the average be reached more certainly and quickly by
observing a little method than by fortuitous wandering.</p>

<p>The subject of the solution of mazes has been examined
by various mathematicians, in their lighter moods,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
but we need not burden ourselves with more than a few
simple considerations.</p>

<p>In most cases it is not practicable to adopt a system
of marking the various paths as we reach them, but if
this be permitted we can so arrange our marks that we
need never traverse any portion of the path more than
twice&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, once in each direction&mdash;so that in any finite
maze we must eventually arrive at the goal, though not
necessarily by the shortest route.</p>

<p>Using the word <i>node</i> to signify a point of branching,
and the terms <i>odd</i> and <i>even</i> to describe respectively those
nodes at which odd or even numbers of paths are to be
found, we see that there must be at least three paths
meeting at a point to form a node, for two paths meeting
at a point constitute only a change of direction of the
path without formation of branches, whilst the arrival of
one path only at a point also precludes the idea of
"branching" at that point, and can only occur at the end
of a blind alley, at the entrance of the maze, or at the
goal. We find it convenient, however, to regard the latter
arrangement as an odd node of the lowest order, the
lowest possible order of even nodes being, of course,
that at the meeting of four paths.</p>

<p>It will be clear that if the entrance and the goal are the
only odd nodes the maze will either be unicursal, in the
sense in which we have been using the term, or any
branches must form loops on the main route; in either
case it will be possible to traverse the maze unicursally,
<i>i.e.</i>, to thread every portion of the path without going
over any part twice.</p>

<p>Supposing that we are able to make what marks we
like, without danger of their removal in our absence, we
can adopt the following plan:</p>

<p>On arriving at a node which, by the absence of marks,
you know you have not already visited, mark the path by
which you have just arrived by three marks; if you see
by marks on other paths that you have already been to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
that node, mark the arrival path with one mark only. If
now there are no unmarked paths at this node, it means
that you have explored this particular branch-system and
must retrace your steps by the path by which you have
arrived. If, however, there are one or more unmarked
paths leading from the node, select one of them, and, as
you enter it, mark it with two marks.</p>

<p>We can now make certain of visiting every part of the
maze if we make it a rule that, on arrival at a node, we
shall never take a path with three marks unless there are
no paths unmarked or with one mark only. When we
enter a one-mark path, we of course add the two marks
which we always make on leaving a node, and thus it
becomes a three-mark path at that node.</p>

<p>When it is impracticable to place marks, or even to
use, like Theseus, a clue of thread, it is still possible in
the majority of cases to make certain of finding the goal
by the simple expedient of placing one hand on the hedge
on entering the maze, and consistently following the
hedge around, keeping contact all the time with the same
hand. Blind turnings present no difficulty, as they will
only be traversed first in one direction and then in the
other. The traveller being guided by his contact with the
hedge alone is relieved of all necessity for making a
choice of paths when arriving at the nodes.</p>

<p>The only case in which this method breaks down is
that in which the goal is situated anywhere within a loop.
Where this occurs the explorer adopting the method
described will discover the fact by finding himself eventually
back at the starting-point without having visited
the goal. He must then adopt different tactics, but unless
it is practicable to use a clue or a system of marks like
that detailed above there is no rule that will help him.
One may, of course, thread the maze by remembering a
formula of some sort applicable to that particular maze,
<i>e.g.</i>, in the case of Hampton Court, "Left, right, right,
left, left, left, left," but this is equivalent to having a plan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
of the maze. Such mnemonics, unless perfectly retained,
are apt to prove more of a nuisance than a help.</p>

<p>Can anybody who has once yielded to the exuberant
mirth of "Three Men in a Boat" forget the predicament
of the over-confident Harris when he volunteered to conduct
a party, strangers as well, through the Hampton
Court maze? "We'll just go in here," he said, "so
that you can say you've been, but it's very simple.
It's absurd to call it a maze. You keep on taking the
first turning to the right. We'll just walk round for ten
minutes and then go and get some lunch." Poor Harris!</p>

<span class="subhead">THE LABYRINTH IN LITERATURE</span></h2>

<p>The romantic and mysterious flavour of the words
"maze" and "labyrinth" has induced many a writer of
fiction to adopt one or the other as the theme of a story,
or as the setting of some of the action in a story, or else
to use the name as an attractive symbolical title for a work.</p>

<p>We have several times already had occasion to refer
to instances of this kind in the course of our survey, but
the reader may have sufficient patience to support the
enumeration of a few more, not by any means exhaustive,
examples.</p>

<p>In most cases where the words are used in book-titles
it is perhaps the allegorical rather than the romantic
element which is in requisition, though truly the two are
never far apart.</p>

<p>The Spanish poet Juan de Mena, in the fifteenth century,
was inspired by Dante's "Divina Commedia" to
compose a ponderous allegorical poem which he named
"El Laberinto." This was published in Seville in 1496
and was a queer mixture of theology, astrology, and universal
history. In it the poet is shown as being guided
by a beautiful woman, symbolising Divine Providence,
through three vast concentric circular regions, representing
respectively the past, the present, and the future.
These are somehow involved with the seven planets,
after which the seven divisions of the poem are named.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
No doubt there were at that time many folk to
whom such a work made a strong appeal, but it was evidently
not the kind of book that we should nowadays
choose to take away for a holiday.</p>

<p>A few years after its publication a French bard, Jean
Bouchet by name, jealous perhaps for the reputation of
his native art, cast upon the astonished world a mythical
epic of between four and five thousand verses, entitled
"Le Labyrinthe de Fortune." In this case the guide is a
female representing Illusion, and her aim seems to have
been to impress the poet, and through him the less gifted
mortals, with the total instability and evanescence of
everything pertaining to humanity.</p>

<p>An "allegorical labyrinth" printed at Lyons in 1769&mdash;the
period, it will be remembered, at which some of
the finest cathedral labyrinths were destroyed&mdash;must
have been the ancestor of some of the Sunday School
pictures of our early youth. It depicted "the spiritual
labyrinth ornamented with four channels of grace representing
(<i>a</i>) the four rivers of the Earthly Paradise and the
happy state of Man before the Fall; (<i>b</i>) by divers convolutions,
the various miseries with which human life has
since been beset; (<i>c</i>) by the fact of the labyrinth terminating
at the same point as that from which it starts, we
see how Man, being formed of earth, returns, as to his
first principle, by the decay of the body; (<i>d</i>) the health-giving
waters of these channels represent the grace of
God in which the depraved soul finds its remedy." This
pious chart is signed "<span class="smcap">Belion</span> <i>fecit</i>."</p>

<p>The curious jumble of crude imagery shown in <a href="#Fig_140">Fig.&nbsp;140</a>
is reproduced from the heading to a long set of allegorical
verses in German, published about 1630. The
King referred to in the title is thought to be Frederick I
of Bohemia.</p>

<div id="ip_194" class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img id="Fig_140" src="images/i_280.jpg" width="500" height="278" alt="" /><div class="caption">Fig. 140. Allegorical Labyrinth. (German Print, <i>circ.</i> 1630)</div></div>

<p>When touching upon the question of etymology we
made reference to the theological "Treatise against the
Four Labyrinths of France," by Walter of St. Victor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
We find the word used in this sense of verbal or mental
entanglements in theological matters as the title of a
book written some five centuries later by Thomas
Carwell (<i>alias</i> Thorold). The full title of this work,
which was printed in Paris in 1658, is: "Labyrinthus
Cantuarensis; or Doctor Lawd's Labyrinth. Beeing an
answer to the late Archbishop of Canterburies relation
of a conference between himself and Mr. Fisher, etc.
Wherein the true grounds of the Roman Catholique
religion are asserted, the principall controuersies betwixt
Catholiques and Protestants thoroughly examined, and
the Bishops meandrick windings throughout his whole
worke layd open to publique view."</p>

<p>"Labyrinthus," according to Hazlitt's Bibliographical
Collections, was the name of a Latin comedy performed
at Cambridge before King James I. Perhaps this had
some connection with that play which Pepys mentions
in his Diary on May 2, 1684: "By coach to the King's
Playhouse to see 'The Labyrinth' ... the poorest play,
methinks, that ever I saw, there being nothing in it but
the odd accidents that fell out, by a lady's being bred up
in man's apparel and a man in a woman's."</p>

<p>In some cases the use of the word "labyrinth" in a
book-title seems to suggest that the term was regarded
as an equivalent for "Thesaurus" or "Compendium
of Knowledge" in respect of any particular branch of
learning. This is the case in the "Gardener's Labyrinth"
of Didymus Mountayne (Thomas Hill), to which we
referred in Chapter XIII. The title has no reference to
the discourse on mazes which occupies a small section
of the book, but simply means the gardener's book of
instructions or <i>vade mecum</i>. Much the same meaning
is conveyed also by the title of a rather earlier book, the
"Labyrinthus Medicorum Errantium" or "Labyrinth
of Lost Physicians," which was one of the last works of
the great Swiss doctor and alchemist Paracelsus, and was
published in 1553, twelve years after his death. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
Polish educational reformer Komensky, better known as
Comenius (1592&ndash;1671), likewise published a "Labyrinthus"
of this kind. An English translation of it was
printed early in the present century under the title of
"The Labyrinth of the World and the Paradise of the
Heart."</p>

<p>The "Labyrinthus" or "Laborintus" ascribed to the
monk Eberhard of Bethune, who wrote in <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 1212 or
thereabouts, is an elaborate and critical treatise on poetry
and pedagogics; it is alternatively entitled "De Miseriis
Rectorum Scholarum," and its reiterated plaints on the
woes of the schoolmaster should find an echo in the
heart of many a present-day instructor of youth.</p>

<p>"<i>Love</i> in these labyrinths his slaves detains," sang
Pope; but he was only making use of an old and well-worn
metaphor, which we mention at the moment
because it has so often figured in book-titles. In 1593
Dr. G. Fletcher, uncle of the dramatist, wrote a poem of
ingenious form entitled "A Lover's Maze." A similar
title, "Love in a Maze," was given by Shirley to one of
his plays, a performance of which was witnessed by
Pepys on May 22, 1662. "The play hath little in it," says
Pepys, "but Lacy's part of a country fellow, which he did
to admiration." In 1611 a suite of poems entitled
"Le Labyrinthe d'Amour" was published by a French
poet, who modestly veiled his identity behind the
initials "<span class="locked">H. F. S. D. C.</span>" A century and a half later
another French writer, equally retiring&mdash;his initials were
"T.&nbsp;M."&mdash;wrote an <i>opéra comique</i> of the same name.</p>

<p>One would almost think that there was something
shameful or dangerous in allowing one's identity to be
revealed in connection with works bearing such titles,
for we find the same desire for anonymity in the writer
of some poems entitled "The Maze" which appeared in
1815, headed by a quotation from Cowper:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"... to and fro,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Caught in a labyrinth you go."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
That the maze or labyrinth has not lost its favour as
either a descriptive or a metaphorical book-title is testified
by the numerous modern examples of its use,
amongst which we may mention Mrs. Henry Wood's
"Within the Maze," "The Maze of Scilly," by E.&nbsp;J.
Tiddy, "The Maze," by A.&nbsp;L. Stewart, "The Labyrinth,"
by R. Murray Gilchrist (perhaps in this case the reference
is to the rambling old House with Eleven Staircases
which features largely in the book), and finally, as an
instance of undeniable descriptiveness, "The Physiology
of the Human Labyrinth," by S. Scott. We have already
made mention of O.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;F. Lodge's play, "The Labyrinth,"
when speaking of Fair Rosamond (Chap. XIX).
The same title has recently been bestowed on one of a
series of fanciful prose sketches by Mr. Martin Armstrong
published collectively as "The Puppet Show."</p>

<p>The Italian aviator-poet Gabriele d'Annunzio, whose
inconvenient conception of patriotism has proved such
a source of embarrassment to his country since the war,
has adopted as a most attractive and appropriate cover-design
for his novel "Forse che si, forse che no" ("Perhaps
yes, perhaps no") a conventional square unicursal labyrinth,
the path of which is occupied by several repetitions,
in block capitals, of the title of the book. The title on the
wrapper of a recent novel by Miss Isabel Ostrander is
accompanied by an effective design in which a female
figure is seen against a background consisting of a plan
of the Hampton Court maze.</p>

<p>Mr. Rudyard Kipling, in that curious collection of
inconsequential whimsicalities which he calls the "Just
so Stories," shows a queer sort of labyrinthine contrivance
in his illustration to the story of "The Crab that
Played," referring to it in the text as "the Big MizMaze."</p>

<p>Lest any reader who happens to be unacquainted with
Sir A.&nbsp;T. Quiller-Couch's novel "Troy Town" should
be misled by the title into antiquarian expectations, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
may as well remark that it has no more connection with
"turf mazes" than had the famous racehorse of the same
name that came to a sad end in 1920&mdash;even less, in a
manner of speaking. It has reference to the same Cornish
seaport as his "Mayor of Troy," that Mayor who was so
popular with the townsfolk that in the next year they
made him an Ex-Mayor.</p>

<p>The vogue of allegory and extravagant symbolism
which flourished in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
was evidenced by the appearance of numbers of
little books of "emblems," mainly based upon those of
Andrea Alciati (1492&ndash;1550), and, as might well be expected,
the labyrinth furnished many an inspiration to
the compilers of these works. The emblem books of the
Dutchman Jacob Cats, for example, and of our own poet
Francis Quarles (1592&ndash;1644), were, like those of Alciati
himself, enormously popular and ran through very many
editions, not only in the native tongues of their authors
but in most of the languages of Europe.</p>

<p>We have already, in Chapter XII, drawn attention to
a labyrinth-emblem in the collection of the French writer
Claude Paradin. A labyrinth of a different type appears
in the "Emblems" of Quarles (<i>e.g.</i>, in the 1635 edition,
bk. iv, no. 2). In this case we are shown a woman walking
away from the centre of what looks like a tall hedge maze,
which has its path on the top of the hedge! With one
hand she holds a staff and in the other a cord, the distant
end of which is held by an angel located at the summit of
a round tower some way off. A winding path proceeds
from this tower to the gateway of the labyrinth. Here and
there one sees unfortunate beings who are slipping from
the wall into the deep crevasses below. A quotation from
the Psalms, in Latin and in English, accompanies this
figure: "Oh that my Wayes were directed to keep Thy
Statutes." The labyrinth shown in most of the other
emblem-books, where one occurs at all, is a very poor
affair and looks rather like a low, flat fortress or an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
inverted cake-tin. A more realistic arrangement, however,
appears in the collection of Jacob Cats.</p>

<p>The Hampton Court maze has more than once figured
in literature. One appearance we have already noticed at
the end of the preceding chapter; another, of a totally
different character, we cull from the <i>British Magazine</i>
for 1747. Few people, one would imagine, look upon a
visit to this popular resort as an occasion for melancholy
meditations, or for chanting moral dirges, but a foreigner
might well be excused for reading the following lines as
a justification of the reproach that Englishmen take their
pleasures sadly.</p>

<p>"tragic gardens, with dark avenues of intertwisted ilexes
immeasurably old, where there might be lurking the emissary
of an ambitious d'Este; gloomy labyrinths of mediaeval yew
concealing the panther-spring of a vindictive Sforza or the

<p>If space permitted, or if any useful purpose were
served, a good deal more might be written concerning
the Labyrinth in relation to Literature. Similarly, the
Labyrinth in Art might form the subject of a fairly bulky
volume. A considerable amount of space could be taken
up with the speculations that have been made as to the
probable relationship of the Knossian design to the
Cross, the Swastika&mdash;with its variants, the Triskelion
and the Tetraskelion&mdash;the Circle, the Spiral, and so
forth; but the reader who thirsts for discussions of this
nature must be referred to more specialised archaeological
literature. The main points of interest with regard
to the use of the labyrinth figure in Art have already been
presented, and most of the lines along which the labyrinth
idea has been elaborated have been indicated,
either in the text or in the illustrations. Before finally
taking leave of our theme, however, there are yet a few
miscellaneous aspects of it at which we may take a glance.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span></p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</a><br />

<span class="subhead">MISCELLANEA AND CONCLUSION</span></h2>

<p>In the <i>Annales Archéologiques</i> for 1857 it was stated that
M. Bonnin, of Evreux, had collected no less than 200
designs of mazes or labyrinths, representative of all sorts
of nations and periods, and the editor promised to make
a selection of these for reproduction as soon as the text
to accompany them should be ready. The editor of
the <i>Annales</i> incidentally referred to an early sixteenth-century
painting on wood, in the palace of the Marquis
Campana, which represented the legend of Theseus and
showed a labyrinth similar to that of St. Maria in Aquiro
at Rome. This also was to have been illustrated at the
same time. The matter seems to have rested there, however,
for no subsequent reference appeared.</p>

<p>As an instance of the unlikely places in which the employment
of labyrinth figures for decorative or symbolic
purposes are sometimes found, we may quote an entry
which occurs in an inventory of the contents of a house
at Duffus, Morayshire, dated May 25, 1708, from which
it would appear that household napery, at that time, was
sometimes patterned with the labyrinth:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<i>In the Nurserie.</i> A large neprie press, wherein there is
six pair Scots holland sheits ... three fyn towels and five of
the walls of troy."</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Albert Way, in his notes to Dr. Trollope's
memoir on Labyrinths in 1858, after referring to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
popularity of mazes and "Troy-towns" in Scotland,
mentions a labyrinth incised on the stone bench in one
of the window recesses of the hall at Craigmillar Castle.</p>

<p>According to a Swedish publication of 1877, labyrinths
have been found in West Gothland engraved on
church bells!</p>

<p>The hedge maze is, of course, the chief embodiment
of the labyrinth idea as a medium of amusement, but it is
far from being the only form in which the principle subserves
this purpose.</p>

<p>We have already referred to the practice, noted in
various parts of England and Wales, of cutting "Troy-towns"
in the turf. Most of us are, moreover, familiar
with the schoolboy pastime of drawing mazes on paper,
or on slates in the days before they were banished on
hygienic grounds; the object of the designer in this case
differing from that of the Troy-town constructors in that
it consists of providing as difficult a puzzle as one's
ingenuity at the moment can devise, whereas the latter
merely laid out a conventional unicursal figure for the
purpose of performing a ceremonial or playing a game
thereon, like the squares for nine-men's morris or the
diagram for hop-scotch.</p>

<p>An ingenious development of the hedge maze principle
is the construction of indoor mazes lined with
mirrors, by means of which the perplexity of the visitor
is very greatly increased. Such "mirror mazes" often
find a place in fairs and exhibitions.</p>

<p>Another method of utilising the puzzle-maze idea,
and one which constitutes a valuable asset to the parent
or nurse in charge of young children at the sea-side, is
that of scratching maze-figures on the sands, of sufficient
dimensions to enable little feet to perambulate the paths.
Figures <a href="#Fig_141">141</a> and <a href="#Fig_142">142</a> show some of the mazes constructed
on the sands of a well-known southern resort in
the summer of 1920. The examples shown were made in
a quiet corner of the beach and were "snapped" before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
the children had discovered them; otherwise, although
no doubt prettier pictures would have resulted, the mazes
would have been invisible.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_143">Figure&nbsp;143</a> shows the plan of a small temporary maze
constructed by the writer for a garden fête held in aid
of local church funds in the grounds of Mr. Kenneth
Goschen, at Eastcote, Middlesex, on May 25, 1921. It
was formed of galvanised-wire netting supported on six-foot
fir stakes and thickened with elm foliage. At the
entrance was displayed a conventional labyrinth design,
slightly modified to convey the misleading suggestion
that it was a key to the maze, and below this were the
following lines:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Beware the dreadful Minotaur<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That dwells within the Maze.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And bones of those he slays.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then softly through the labyrinth creep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rouse him not to strife.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take one short peep, prepare to leap<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And run to save your life!</i><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">At the goal was placed a chair facing an embowered mirror.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
Some readers may remember the publication many
years ago of highly coloured lithographs of mazes, of
bizarre design, generally emanating from the Continent
and sold for a penny or twopence. An old scrap-book
seen by the writer contains some specimens of this nature,
published in Brussels. In some the "nodes" are occupied
by various objects which, according to the printed instructions,
have to be visited in a given order. One design,
generously tinted in all the colours of the spectrum, is
labelled "Le Jardin Chinois," although there is nothing
distinctively Chinese about it except the absence of all
resemblance to anything European.
One may still purchase
in the toy-shops coloured labyrinths
of this kind, mounted
on cardboard, with spaces at
various points of the path for
the accommodation of counters,
which are moved progressively
in accordance with
the throws of dice by the competing
players.</p>

<p>Some very ingenious applications
of the labyrinth idea
have been evolved by modern designers of toys and
games.</p>

<div id="ip_204" class="figcenter" style="width: 498px;"><img id="Fig_144" src="images/i_293.jpg" width="498" height="500" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 144.</span>&mdash;Maze Toy by
A. Brentano. (After Patent Specification.)</div></div>

<p>Perhaps the most popular toy of this nature on the
market is that of the "Pigs in Clover" type, consisting of
a series of concentric interrupted circular walls, the innermost
of which constitutes the goal into which the player
strives to roll all the marbles&mdash;usually three in number&mdash;which
are seen through the glass cover (<a href="#Fig_144">Fig.&nbsp;144</a>).
This toy was patented by A. Brentano in 1889. Some
skill is required to get all the marbles into the central
compartment at the same time. Another toy of this
character is seen in <a href="#Fig_145">Fig.&nbsp;145</a>. It consists of a rather complicated
maze formed of ridges, between which the player<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
rolls a ball or a globule of mercury from the point marked
A to that marked B, or <i>vice versa</i>. This was patented by
S.&nbsp;D. Nix in 1891.</p>

<p>A somewhat similar arrangement, but with the addition
of magnetism as the motive force, is that devised by
J.&nbsp;M. Arnot in 1894, and shown in <a href="#Fig_146">Fig.&nbsp;146</a>. In this
case the maze is not flat but is in the form of a shallow
dome; the balls are of iron and are rolled not by tilting
the box but by moving a magnet beneath it.</p>

<div id="ip_205" class="figcenter" style="width: 402px;"><img id="Fig_145" src="images/i_294.jpg" width="402" height="500" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 145.</span>&mdash;Maze Toy by S.&nbsp;D. Nix. (After Patent Specification.)</div></div>

<p>R.&nbsp;A. Cuthbert and W. Bevitt patented in 1889 a toy
in which a ball, called "The Man in the Maze," is rolled
about inside a small closed box, the internal partitions
of which cannot be seen but are indicated on the outside
of the case. The "Man" is invisible during his
journey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
At about the same time a somewhat similar toy was
brought out by J. Proctor, in which, however, the travelling
ball can be watched through the glass top, the puzzle
element in this case consisting of the use of circular holes
of two sizes for communicating between adjacent compartments,
one size being just large enough to permit of
the passage of the ball, the other just too small (<a href="#Fig_147">Fig.&nbsp;147</a>).</p>

<div id="ip_206" class="figcenter" style="width: 313px;"><img id="Fig_146" src="images/i_295.jpg" width="313" height="500" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 146.</span>&mdash;Maze Toy by J.&nbsp;M. Arnot.

Specification.)</div></div>

<p>The most complex puzzle of the kind so far produced
is that patented by H. Bridge in 1906 and shown in
<a href="#Fig_148">Fig.&nbsp;148</a>. The ball in this case is made to pass through
channels formed between projections of labyrinthine
pattern fixed to a base and others fixed to the transparent
top, which can be moved relatively to the base. The toy
may be of a circular pattern or rectangular. In the
former case the top is rotated, in the latter it is slid from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
side to side. The patent also covers cases in which the
toy is constructed on the "skeleton" principle, the use of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
a ring in place of a ball, and the combination of more than
two mazes.</p>

<p>It now remains for some inventor of Einsteinian proclivities
to devise one in several dimensions!</p>

<p>An interesting little study in what one might call
"Labyrinth Psychology" was carried out by an Austrian
biologist in connection with his researches on "The Evolution
of Efficiency in the Animal Kingdom," in 1917.
This was a series of experiments to test the efficiency of
animals in learning to thread a labyrinth in search of
food. <a href="#Fig_149">Figs.&nbsp;149, 150 and 151</a> show three stages in the
education of a rat in this respect, the dotted line representing
the track followed by the animal from the
entrance to the food-containing centre of a simple form
of labyrinth.</p>

<p>Some sort of game, known as "Labyrinthe," enjoyed
a passing favour in France in the eighteenth century. An
advertisement of May 8, 1869, referring to one offered
for sale by a Parisian upholsterer named Lechevin,
describes it as "un jeu de labyrinthe a 11 cases doré
d'or moulu, avec tableau dans chaque case," but this does
not tell us much concerning the nature of the pastime.</p>

<p>A card game of similar name was played in this
country half a century ago; it was a kind of bezique.</p>

<p>In France the name "Labyrinthe" is also given to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
children's game in which the majority of the players
hold hands so as to form a chain of arches which are
threaded by two runners called respectively <i>le tisserand</i>
and <i>la navette</i>&mdash;"the weaver" and "the shuttle."</p>

<p>A visitor to the Latin Convent on the summit of
Mount Carmel, Palestine, in 1874, described a "verbal
labyrinth" which he saw displayed on a board hanging
on the wall of an inner staircase. It was called "The
Labyrinth of St. Bernard," and consisted of a number
of words or short phrases arranged in a square, as shown
below. By selecting the words in the proper order five
maxims are obtained "by which man may live well."
The first of these maxims, commencing with the word
at the foot of the left-hand column, is: <i>Noli dicere omnia
quae scis quia qui dicit omnia quae scit saepe audit quod non
vult</i>.</p>

<p>The remaining four injunctions may be read by
similarly utilising the words in the bottom row with those
in the second, third, fourth, and fifth rows respectively:</p>

<p class="p1">As a sample of a verbal labyrinth this seems to be
very simple and straightforward in comparison with the
average Act of Parliament.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
Let us turn now, for a brief space, to a question which,
although bearing upon matters dealt with earlier in the
book, has been too little investigated to warrant more
than a nodding reference in our more serious chapters&mdash;the
question of place-names.</p>

<p>The occurrence of a suggestive place-name is, as previously
hinted, very slender evidence by itself on which
to form an opinion of the former existence of a maze in
the locality. There is always the possibility that the name
may be a corruption of some ancient word of very
different significance, perhaps the name of some person,
or that it may have been bestowed fancifully or in respect
of some resemblance to another place.</p>

<p>In the absence of fuller information we will limit ourselves
to the bare mention of such names as convey a
suggestion of possible maze sites, merely remarking any
cases in which evidence in one direction or the other has
come to notice.</p>

<p>The district known as Maze Pond, familiar to Londoners
in the neighbourhood of the Borough, and to
which we made reference in Chapter XV, takes its
name from the ancient manor of the Maze, which was
in the holding of Sir John Burcestre in the fifteenth
century. An old token bears the inscription, "Michael
Blower, at ye Maze, Southwarke." What kind of
maze, if any, formerly existed in the locality we do not
know.</p>

<p>Maze Hill has sometimes been assumed to derive its
name from a maze which is supposed to have existed in the
park of the former royal palace of Greenwich (see p. 136),
but the name was formerly spelt in a different manner and
may have quite another origin. In Hasted's "History of
Kent," 1778, it is referred to as Mease Hill, and it has
been suggested that this may have come from the Celtic
word <i>Maes</i>, meaning "field." There is a Maze Green
in Hertfordshire, near Bishops Stortford. Possibly there
was formerly a turf maze in the vicinity like that on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
Saffron Walden common, not very far away, but we have
no evidence to that effect.</p>

<p>A few miles west of Lisburn, in Ireland, are two places
named respectively "The Maze" and "Mazetown," the
former a small village in Antrim, the latter a racing
centre just over the county border in Down.</p>

<p>"Troy-town," as we have seen, also occurs as a place-name.
In Dorset there is one near Dorchester and
another near Bere Regis. These are alleged to be the
sites of former turf mazes, of which, however, there are
no authentic records. In Kent there is one near Hastingleigh,
and the name also occurs at <span class="locked">Rochester.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></span> The latter
is said to commemorate a former owner or builder of
property in that part of the town, whose name happened
to be Troy. A part of Peckham also used to be known as
Troy-town.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_7" id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> See also p. <a href="#Page_91">91</a>.</p></div>

<p>The word "Troy" alone is also of fairly frequent
occurrence, as for instance near Stalybridge, Lancs,
and near Londonderry; Troy Michell and Troy Hall are
found in Monmouthshire, and the latter name also at
Blackburn, Lancs, but such names are no more likely
to have any connection with ancient maze sites than is
the flourishing city of similar name in the United States,
the probability being that in all these cases it is the
famous Troy of the Iliad that furnished the inspiration.
The name of Troy-town may in some cases have been
given on account of irregularity or intricacy of design,
for the word is found in certain local dialects as a
synonym for a state of confusion, an untidy house being
said to be "just like Troy-town."</p>

<p>It is surely uncommon for the word "Labyrinth"
itself to be found as a place-name, but in February 1911
Captain Scott pitched his camp in an Antarctic spot
which, on account of the fantastically sinuous nature of
its surroundings, he decided to name "Labyrinth Camp."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
We must now draw to a close.</p>

<p>Enough has perhaps been said to give some idea of the
variety and extent of the different ways in which the
labyrinth idea has developed and in which it has been
employed, but it would obviously be wrong to assume
that the last word on the subject has now been pronounced.</p>

<p>As regards the early history of the idea and of the
terms associated with it we have seen that the boundaries
of our knowledge are still misty and ill-defined, a circumstance
that only gives zest to the study of the subject.</p>

<p>We see that our enquiry has taken us into realms
far removed from everyday experience and in which we
feel the need of special training in order to weigh the
facts presented. It has given us glimpses of the workshop
of the archaeologist, the anthropologist, and the
etymologist.</p>

<p>The study of later developments has led us into curious
by-paths of art and literature&mdash;classical, mediaeval, renaissance,
and modern&mdash;and we see that even now the
labyrinth idea has not entirely ceased to exercise its
allurements or to evoke the spirit of invention.</p>

<p>There is still room for a good deal of research and for
the possibility of highly interesting discoveries in respect
of almost every phase of the labyrinth's past history.</p>

<p>With regard to its future developments, much as we
should have liked to close our review with a vindication
of utilitarian interest, and although one can never safely
prophesy to what uses the ingenuity of men may put any
given principle, we could not hope to sound an expectant
note without creating an impression of fatuity. Lest this
statement be taken to mean that our enquiry has, therefore,
had no practical aim, let us hasten to repeat once
more the hope expressed in our introductory chapter to
the effect that a perusal of this little book will at least
ensure a revival of interest in, and consequently the
preservation of, those few relics of rustic revelry and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
prehistoric magic which yet remain with us in the shape
of the turf labyrinths.</p>

<p>As Mr. A.&nbsp;H. Allcroft, in his "Earthwork of England"
(1908), has truly remarked, when speaking of the
Asenby maze: "It is marvellous that the memory of such
things, once prominent features of rural life, can die out
so rapidly as it does." And yet, who can deny that they
are worthy of at least as much care and interest as many
of the obvious and commonplace antiquities upon which
the guide-books lavish their encomiums?</p>

<p>We need not emulate the misguided enthusiasm of
those who are unable to discover a merit in a bygone
practice without plunging into an indiscriminate advocacy
of its revival&mdash;an enthusiasm which inevitably
brings discredit upon its object&mdash;but let us at any rate
see to it that no more of these rare and interesting heirlooms
are lost to us through ignorance or neglect.</p>

<h2><a name="Transcribers_Notes" id="Transcribers_Notes">Transcribers' Notes</a></h2>

<p>Punctuation, hyphenation, and spelling were made consistent when a predominant
preference was found in this book; otherwise they were not changed.</p>

<p>Simple typographical errors were corrected; occasional unbalanced
quotation marks retained.</p>

<p>Ambiguous hyphens at the ends of lines were retained.</p>

<p>Inconsistent use of small-caps for the abbreviation "Fig." has been
retained: full-page Plates did not use small-caps; other illustrations did.</p>

<p>Many quotations are from older sources that used archaic spelling.</p>

<p>Words not in Modern English have not been checked for spelling.</p>

<p>Index not checked for proper alphabetization or correct page references.</p>

<p>Illustrations ("Figures") are presented here in the irregularly-numbered
sequence in which they appeared in the original book.</p>

<p>Greek words are shown in Greek and then in English transliterations
that are indicated by [Greek: ] and were added by the Transcribers.</p>

<p>Text uses both "Archæologia" and "Archaeologia"; both retained.</p>

<p>Missing or incorrect accent marks in German words have not been changed.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_67">67</a>: the Greek word transliterated as "taurokathapsia"
was misprinted in the original book and has been changed here.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_68">68</a>: Tildes (~) above "Ã" and "Ñ" represent macrons (¯);
colons in the inscription represent tricolons.</p>

<p>Page 78: "Ackermann's" has been corrected in accordance with the <i>Erratum</i> on
page xviii.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_96">96</a>: Tilde (~) above "õ" represents a macron (¯).</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_132">132</a>: "Beginning it self" was printed that way, with the extra space.</p>

<p>Index, page <a href="#Page_245">245</a>: "House of the Labyrinth" referenced non-existent page "456", which was
changed here to page "<a href="#Page_45">45</a>".</p>

<p>Index, page <a href="#Page_247">247</a>: "Metaphor" references non-existent page "282".</p>
